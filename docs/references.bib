abstract = {New diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods, including high-b, q-space, and high angular resolution MRI methods, attempt to extract information about non-Gaussian diffusion in tissue that is not provided by low-b-value (b approximately 1000 s mm(-2)) diffusion or diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). Additionally, DWI data with higher spatial resolution are being acquired to resolve fine anatomic structures, such as white matter fasciculi. Increasing diffusion-weighting or decreasing voxel size can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio so that some DWI signals are close to the background noise level. Here we report several new artifacts that can be explained by considering how background noise affects the peanut-shaped angular apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profile. These include an orientationally dependent deviation from Gaussian behavior of the ADC profile, an underestimation of indices of diffusion anisotropy, and a correlation between estimates of mean diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy. We also discuss how noise can cause increased gray/white matter DWI contrast at higher b values and an apparent elevation of diffusion anisotropy in acute ischemia. Importantly, all of these artifacts are negligible in the b-value range typically used in DT-MRI of brain (b approximately 1000 s mm(-2)). Finally, we demonstrate a strategy for ameliorating the rectified noise artifact in data collected at higher b values.},

abstract = {We readdress the diffusion tractography problem in a global and probabilistic manner. Instead of tracking through local orientations, we parameterise the connexions between brain regions at a global level, and then infer on global and local parameters simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. This approach offers a number of important benefits. The global nature of the tractography reduces sensitivity to local noise and modelling errors. By constraining tractography to ensure a connexion is found, and then inferring on the exact location of the connexion, we increase the robustness of connectivity-based parcellations, allowing parcellations of connexions that were previously invisible to tractography. The Bayesian framework allows a direct comparison of the evidence for connecting and non-connecting models, to test whether the connexion is supported by the data. Crucially, by explicit parameterisation of the connexion between brain regions, we infer on a parameter that is shared with models of functional connectivity. This model is a first step toward the joint inference on functional and anatomical connectivity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental difficulties in engineering design is the multiplicity of local solutions. This has triggered much effort in the development of global search algorithms. Globality, however, often has a prohibitively high numerical cost for real problems. A fixed cost local search, which sequentially becomes global, is developed in this work. Globalization is achieved by probabilistic restarts. A spacial probability of starting a local search is built based on past searches. An improved Nelder–Mead algorithm is the local optimizer. It accounts for variable bounds and nonlinear inequality constraints. It is additionally made more robust by reinitializing degenerated simplexes. The resulting method, called the Globalized Bounded Nelder–Mead (GBNM) algorithm, is particularly adapted to tackling multimodal, discontinuous, constrained optimization problems, for which it is uncertain that a global optimization can be afforded. Numerical experiments are given on two analytical test functions and two composite laminate design problems. The GBNM method compares favorably with an evolutionary algorithm, both in terms of numerical cost and accuracy.},

abstract = {This article introduces a new and general framework for optimizing the experiment design for diffusion MRI of samples with unknown orientation. An illustration then uses the framework to study the feasibility of measuring direct features of brain-tissue microstructure in vivo. The study investigates the accuracy and precision with which we can estimate potentially important new biomarkers such as axon density and radius in white matter. Simulation experiments use a simple model of white matter based on CHARMED (composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion). The optimization finds acquisition protocols achievable on modern human and animal systems that consist of 120 measurements with fixed maximum gradient strengths. Axon radii in brain tissue are typically in the range 0.25-10 microm. Simulations suggest that estimates of radii in the range 5-10 microm have highest precision and that a maximum gradient strength of 0.07 T m(-1) is sufficient to distinguish radii of 5, 10, and 20 microm. Smaller radii are more difficult to distinguish from one another but are identifiable as small. A maximum gradient strength of 0.2 T m(-1) distinguishes radii of 1 and 2 microm. The simulations also suggest that axon densities and diffusivity parameters in the normal range for white matter are recoverable. The experiment-design optimization has applications well beyond the current work to optimize the protocol for fitting any model of the diffusion process.},

@article{Christen2010,
abstract = {We develop a new general purpose MCMC sampler for arbitrary continuous distributions that requires no tuning. We call this MCMC the t-walk. The t-walk maintains two independent points in the sample space, and all moves are based on proposals that are then accepted with a standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability on the product space. Hence the t-walk is provably convergent under the usual mild requirements. We restrict proposal distributions, or `moves', to those that produce an algorithm that is invariant to scale, and approximately invariant to affine transformations of the state space. Hence scaling of proposals, and effectively also coordinate transformations, that might be used to increase efficiency of the sampler, are not needed since the t-walk's operation is identical on any scaled version of the target distribution. Four moves are given that result in an effective sampling algorithm. We use the simple device of updating only a random subset of coordinates at each step to allow application of the t-walk to high-dimensional problems. In a series of test problems across dimensions we find that the t-walk is only a small factor less efficient than optimally tuned algorithms, but significantly outperforms general random-walk M-H samplers that are not tuned for specific problems. Further, the t-walk remains effective for target distributions for which no optimal affine transformation exists such as those where correlation structure is very different in differing regions of state space. Several examples are presented showing good mixing and convergence characteristics, varying in dimensions from 1 to 200 and with radically different scale and correlation structure, using exactly the same sampler.

abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1 is acquiring high-quality in vivo macroscopic-level connectome imaging data from over a thousand healthy adult subjects in an effort to elucidate the neural pathways and networks that underlie brain function and behavior. An overarching aim is to reveal much about what makes us uniquely human and what makes individuals different from each other by understanding how brain networks integrate information through the complex pattern of neural connections. To date, data sets from 500 subjects have been publicly released, including imaging data measuring functional and structural brain connectivity, as well as 280 non-imaging subject measures (SMs), including demographics (age, sex, income, education level, drug use, etc.), psychometrics (IQ, language performance, etc.) and other behavioral measures such as 'rule-breaking behavior' . We sought to relate functional connectomes to behavior in a single integrated analysis. This goes further than simply investigating which SMs correlate with other SMs; we wanted to discover whether any specific patterns of brain connectivity are associated with specific sets of correlated demographics and behavior, as brain-behavior modes of population co-variation. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 461 HCP subjects, and network modeling tools from FSL (FMRIB Software Library). A population-average brain parcellation was estimated using independent component analysis 2 , yielding 200 distinct brain regions; these constitute the nodes in our network modeling. The functional connections (edges) between these nodes were estimated using Tikhonov-regularized partial correlation, resulting in a 200 × 200 connectome for each subject. These connec-tomes were combined into a single large connectome matrix (con-taining all connectomes from all subjects; Supplementary Fig. 1). Separately, 158 behavioral and demographic non-imaging SMs from the same set of subjects were formed into a subject measure matrix. We regressed potential confounds (including brain size and head motion) out of both matrices. Redundancies among connectomes and SMs were reduced by (separately) keeping just the first 100 principal components of each matrix. A natural choice of method for investigating underlying relation-ships between two sets of variables is canonical correlation analysis (CCA) 3 , a procedure that seeks maximal correlations between com-binations of variables in both sets. Using CCA, we estimated pairs of canonical variates along which sets of SMs and patterns of brain con-nectivity co-vary in a similar way across subjects. We refer to each such pair of variates as a mode of co-variation. Strict tests were applied to avoid over-fitting and false-positive inflation. Statistical significance was determined with a permutation test that accounted for the fam-ily structure of the HCP data 4 . This analysis revealed a single highly significant CCA mode that relates functional connectomes to subject measures (r = 0.87, P {\textless} 10 −5 corrected for multiple comparisons across all modes estimated). These analyses were driven by and report only correlations; inferring and interpreting the (presumably complex and diverse) causalities remains a challenging issue for the future.},

abstract = {The choice of prior distributions for the variances can be important and quite difficult in Bayesian hierarchical and variance component models. For situations where little prior information is available, a 'noninformative' type prior is usually chosen. 'Noninformative' priors have been discussed by many authors and used in many contexts. However, care must be taken using these prior distributions as many are improper and thus, can lead to improper posterior distributions. Additionally, in small samples, these priors can be 'informative'. In this paper, we investigate a proper 'vague' prior, the uniform shrinkage prior (Strawderman 1971; Christiansen {\&} Morris 1997). We discuss its properties and show how posterior distributions for common hierarchical models using this prior lead to proper posterior distributions. We also illustrate the attractive frequentist properties of this prior for a normal hierarchical model including testing and estimation. To conclude, we generalize this prior to the multivariate situation of a covariance matrix. /// Le choix d'une loi a priori pour les variances peut s'av{\'{e}}rer {\`{a}} la fois difficile et important dans le cadre d'une analyse bay{\'{e}}sienne hi{\'{e}}rarchique ou d'un mod{\`{e}}le des composantes de la variance.

abstract = {A unifying theoretical and algorithmic framework for diffusion tensor estimation is presented. Theoretical connections among the least squares (LS) methods, (linear least squares (LLS), weighted linear least squares (WLLS), nonlinear least squares (NLS) and their constrained counterparts), are established through their respective objective functions, and higher order derivatives of these objective functions, i.e., Hessian matrices. These theoretical connections provide new insights in designing efficient algorithms for NLS and constrained NLS (CNLS) estimation. Here, we propose novel algorithms of full Newton-type for the NLS and CNLS estimations, which are evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the commonly used Levenberg-Marquardt method. The proposed methods have a lower percent of relative error in estimating the trace and lower reduced $\chi$2 value than those of the Levenberg-Marquardt method. These results also demonstrate that the accuracy of an estimate, particularly in a nonlinear estimation problem, is greatly affected by the Hessian matrix. In other words, the accuracy of a nonlinear estimation is algorithm-dependent. Further, this study shows that the noise variance in diffusion weighted signals is orientation dependent when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low (≤5). A new experimental design is, therefore, proposed to properly account for the directional dependence in diffusion weighted signal variance.},

@article{Watanabe2012,
abstract = {A statistical model or a learning machine is called regular if the map taking a parameter to a probability distribution is one-to-one and if its Fisher information matrix is always positive definite. If otherwise, it is called singular. In regular statistical models, the Bayes free energy, which is defined by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal likelihood, can be asymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion (BIC), whereas in singular models such approximation does not hold. Recently, it was proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is asymptotically given by a generalized formula using a birational invariant, the real log canonical threshold (RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters in BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs in several statistical models are now being discovered based on algebraic geometrical methodology. However, it has been difficult to estimate the Bayes free energy using only training samples, because an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution. In the present paper, we define a widely applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) by the average log likelihood function over the posterior distribution with the inverse temperature {\$}1/\backslashlog n{\$}, where {\$}n{\$} is the number of training samples. We mathematically prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic expansion as the Bayes free energy, even if a statistical model is singular for and unrealizable by a statistical model. Since WBIC can be numerically calculated without any information about a true distribution, it is a generalized version of BIC onto singular statistical models.},

@article{Daducci2015,
abstract = {Microstructure imaging from diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) data represents an invaluable tool to study non-invasively the morphology of tissues and to provide a biological insight into their microstructural organization. In recent years, a variety of biophysical models have been proposed to associate particular patterns observed in the measured signal with specific microstructural properties of the neuronal tissue, such as axon diameter and fiber density. Despite very appealing results showing that the estimated microstructure indices agree very well with histological examinations, existing techniques require computationally very expensive non-linear procedures to fit the models to the data which, in practice, demand the use of powerful computer clusters for large-scale applications. In this work, we present a general framework for Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimization (AMICO) and show how to re-formulate this class of techniques as convenient linear systems which, then, can be efficiently solved using very fast algorithms. We demonstrate this linearization of the fitting problem for two specific models, i.e. ActiveAx and NODDI, providing a very attractive alternative for parameter estimation in those techniques; however, the AMICO framework is general and flexible enough to work also for the wider space of microstructure imaging methods. Results demonstrate that AMICO represents an effective means to accelerate the fit of existing techniques drastically (up to four orders of magnitude faster) while preserving accuracy and precision in the estimated model parameters (correlation above 0.9). We believe that the availability of such ultrafast algorithms will help to accelerate the spread of microstructure imaging to larger cohorts of patients and to study a wider spectrum of neurological disorders.},

abstract = {With the performance of central processing units (CPUs) having effectively reached a limit, parallel processing offers an alternative for applications with high computational demands. Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) are massively parallel processors that can execute simultaneously thousands of light-weight processes. In this study, we propose and implement a parallel GPU-based design of a popular method that is used for the analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). More specifically, we are concerned with a model-based approach for extracting tissue structural information from diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI data. DW-MRI offers, through tractography approaches, the only way to study brain structural connectivity, non-invasively and in-vivo. We parallelise the Bayesian inference framework for the ball {\&} stick model, as it is implemented in the tractography toolbox of the popular FSL software package (University of Oxford). For our implementation, we utilise the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model. We show that the parameter estimation, performed through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is accelerated by at least two orders of magnitude, when comparing a single GPU with the respective sequential single-core CPU version. We also illustrate similar speed-up factors (up to 120x) when comparing a multi-GPU with a multi-CPU implementation.},

abstract = {There is much interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information on anatomical connectivity in the brain by measuring the diffusion of water in white matter tracts. Among the measures, the most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies local tract directionality and integrity. Many multi-subject imaging studies are using FA images to localize brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. In a recent paper, we presented a new approach, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), which aims to solve crucial issues of cross-subject data alignment, allowing localized cross-subject statistical analysis. This works by transforming the data from the centers of the tracts that are consistent across a study's subjects into a common space. In this protocol, we describe the MRI data acquisition and analysis protocols required for TBSS studies of localized change in brain connectivity across multiple subjects.},

Although the stationary distribution of the AP algorithm is slightly biased, it appears to provide an efficient tool for, e.g., reasonably low dimensional problems, as typically encountered in non-linear regression problems in natural sciences. As a realistic example we include a successful application of the AP algorithm in parameter estimation for the satellite instrument `GOMOS'.

Implementation entailed spatially warping EP images obtained without diffusion weighting (b = 0) to long-echo T(2)-weighted fast spin echo images, collected for anatomical delineation, tissue segmentation, and coregistration with the diffusion images. Using the optimal warping procedure (third-order polynomial), the effects of age on FA and a quantitative measure of intervoxel coherence (C) in the genu, splenium, centrum semiovale, and frontal and parietal pericallosal white matter were examined in 31 healthy men (23-76 years).

abstract = {The corpus callosum is the largest white matter connection in the human brain, and an understanding of its evolution with age in healthy individuals is one crucial aspect for determining its role in cognition and disease. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows for investigation of age-related callosal changes since tractography can both virtually reconstruct the segments of the corpus callosum in vivo based on unique target cortical regions, and provide quantitative diffusion parameters reflecting tissue microstructure. DTI tractography was used to subdivide the corpus callosum into seven distinct sections based on unique target areas (i.e., orbital frontal, anterior frontal, superior frontal, superior parietal, posterior parietal, temporal, and occipital) in a very large number of healthy volunteers (n=315) across a wide age range (5-59. years). Both fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) changes with respect to age were fit with Poisson curves, showing increasing FA and decreasing MD during childhood and adolescence and slightly slower decreases of FA and increases of MD at older ages. Age at peak FA values and minimum MD values varied from 21 to 44. years, and an overall "outer-to-inner" trend was observed in which the anterior and posterior regions peaked earlier than central areas. In addition to these maturational trends of diffusion parameters reflecting the microstructural changes in the healthy corpus callosum over a large age range spanning childhood to older adulthood, these results can provide a baseline for identifying the presence and timing of callosal abnormalities in various brain disorders. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper describes a simple procedure to estimate the parameters of the univariate truncated normal and lognormal distributions by maximum likelihood. It starts from a reparameterization of the lognormal that was previously introduced by the author and is especially useful when the lognormal is close to a power law, which is a limiting case of the first distribution. One of the new parameters quantifies the distance from the power law, and vanishes when the power law gives a sufficient description of the data. At this point, the other parameter equals the exponent of the power law. In contrast, when using the standard parameterization, the parameters of the lognormal diverge in the neighborhood of the power law. Whether or not we are in this neighborhood, the new parameters have properties that ease the process of estimation.},

In this paper we introduce an adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm, where the Gaussian proposal distribution is updated along the process using the full information cumulated so far. Due to the adaptive nature of the process, the AM algorithm is non-Markovian, but we establish here that it has the correct ergodic properties. We also include the results of our numerical tests, which indicate that the AM algorithm competes well with traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and demonstrate that the AM algorithm is easy to use in practical computation.},

abstract = {Finite-diﬀerence methods for computing the derivative of a function with respect to an independent variable require knowledge of the perturbation step size for that variable. Although rules of thumb exist for determining the magnitude of the step size, their eﬀectiveness diminishes for complicated functions or when numerically solving diﬃcult optimization problems. This dissertation investigates the problem of determining the step size that minimizes the total error associated with ﬁnite-diﬀerence derivative approxima- tions. The total error is deﬁned as the sum of errors from numerical sources (roundoﬀ error) and mathematical approximations (truncation error). Several ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximations are considered, and expressions are derived for the errors associated with each approximation. Analysis of these errors leads to an algorithm that determines the optimal perturbation step size that minimizes the total error. A beneﬁt of this algorithm is that the computed optimal step size, when used with neighboring values of the independent variable, results in approximately the same magnitude of error in the derivative. This allows the same step size to be used for several successive iterations of the independent variable in an optimization loop. A range of independent variable values for which the optimal step size can safely remain constant is also computed. In addition to roundoﬀ and truncation errors within the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method, numerical errors within the actual function implementation are also con- sidered. It is shown that the optimal step size can be used to compute an upper bound for these condition errors, without any prior knowledge of the function implementation. Knowledge of a function's condition error is of great assistance during the debugging stages of simulation design. Although the fundamental analysis assumes a scalar function of a scalar independent variable, it is later extended to the general case of a vector function of a vector independent variable. Several numerical examples are shown, rang- ing from simple polynomial and trigonometric functions to complex tra jectory optimization problems. In each example, the step size is computed using the al- gorithm developed herein, a rule-of-thumb method, and an alternative statistical algorithm, and the resulting ﬁnite-diﬀerence derivatives are compared to the true derivative where available.},

A further variation completes the method, and its ensures that the convergence rate from a bad approximation to a minimum is always efficient. Practical applications of the procedure have proved to be very satisfactory, and numerical examples are given in which functions of up to twenty variables are minimized.},

Using the neurochemical specificity of [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning, combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity, we found endogenous dopamine release in the striatum at peak emotional arousal during music listening. To examine the time course of dopamine release, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same stimuli and listeners, and found a functional dissociation: the caudate was more involved during the anticipation and the nucleus accumbens was more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. These results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. Notably, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the peak pleasure itself. Our results help to explain why music is of such high value across all human societies.},

abstract = {This article proposes a new measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD) for the analysis of high angular resolution diffusion-weighted images using higher-order information provided by fibre orientation distributions (FODs) computed using spherical deconvolution. AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that uses cluster-based inference of differences extended throughout space and orientation. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by performing voxel-based AFD comparisons between a group of Motor Neurone Disease patients and healthy control subjects.A significant decrease in AFD was detected along voxels and orientations corresponding to both the corticospinal tract and corpus callosal fibres that connect the primary motor cortices. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using this type of analysis by identifying differences along single fibre bundles in regions containing multiple fibre populations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Brain white matter connections have become a focus of major interest with important maturational processes occurring in newborns. To study the complex microstructural developmental changes in-vivo, it is imperative that non-invasive neuroimaging approaches are developed for this age-group. Multi-b-value diffusion weighted imaging data were acquired in 13 newborns, and the biophysical compartment diffusion models CHARMED-light and NODDI, providing new microstructural parameters such as intra-neurite volume fraction (??. in) and neurite orientation dispersion index (ODI), were developed for newborn data. Comparative analysis was performed and twenty ROIs in the white matter were investigated. Diffusion tensor imaging and both biophysical compartment models highlighted the compact and oriented structure of the corpus-callosum with the highest FA and ??. in values and the smallest ODI values. We could clearly differentiate, using the FA, ??. in and ODI, the posterior and anterior internal capsule representing similar cellular structure but with different maturation (i.e. partially myelinated and absence of myelin, respectively). Late maturing regions (external capsule and periventricular crossroads of pathways) had lower ??. in values, but displayed significant differences in ODI. The compartmented models CHARMED-light and NODDI bring new indices corroborating the cellular architectures, with the lowest ??. in, reflecting the late maturation of areas with thin non-myelinated fibers, and with highest ODI indicating the presence of fiber crossings and fanning.The application of biophysical compartment diffusion models adds new insights to the brain white matter development in vivo. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {The diameter of a myelinated nerve axon is directly proportional to its conduction velocity, so the axon diameter distribution helps determine the channel capacity of nervous transmission along fascicles in the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS). Previously, this histological information could only be obtained using invasive tissue biopsies. Here we propose a new NMR-based approach that employs a model of water diffusion within "restricted" cylindrical axons to estimate their diameter distribution within a nerve bundle. This approach can be combined with MRI to furnish an estimate of the axon diameter distribution within each voxel. This method is validated by comparing the diameter distributions measured using the NMR and histological techniques on sciatic and optic nerve tissue specimens. The axon diameter distribution measured in each voxel of porcine spinal cord using MRI and using histological methods were similar. Applications are expected in longitudinal studies designed to follow nerve growth in normal and abnormal development, as well as in diagnosing disorders and diseases affecting specific populations of axons in the CNS and PNS.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a technique for a previously unaddressed problem, namely, mapping axon diameter in crossing fiber regions, using diffusion MRI. Direct measurement of tissue microstructure of this kind using diffusion MRI offers a new class of biomarkers that give more specific information about tissue than measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging. Most existing techniques for axon diameter mapping assume a single axon orientation in the tissue model, which limits their application to only the most coherently oriented brain white matter, such as the corpus callosum, where the single orientation assumption is a reasonable one. However, fiber crossings and other complex configurations are widespread in the brain. In such areas, the existing techniques will fail to provide useful axon diameter indices for any of the individual fiber populations. We propose a novel crossing fiber tissue model to enable axon diameter mapping in voxels with crossing fibers. We show in simulation that the technique can provide robust axon diameter estimates in a two-fiber crossing with the crossing angle as small as 45 degrees. Using ex vivo imaging data, we further demonstrate the feasibility of the technique by establishing reasonable axon diameter indices in the crossing region at the interface of the cingulum and the corpus callosum.},

The existing techniques of this kind assume a single axon orientation in the tissue model, which may be a reasonable approximation only for the most coherently oriented brain white matter, such as the corpus callosum. For most other areas, orientation dispersion is not negligible and, if unaccounted for, leads to overestimation of the axon diameters, prohibiting their accurate mapping over the whole brain. Here we propose a new model that captures the effect of orientation dispersion explicitly. A numerical scheme is developed to compute the diffusion signal prescribed by the proposed model efficiently, which supports the simultaneous estimation of the axon diameter and orientation dispersion. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that the new model provides an axon diameter index that is robust to the presence of orientation dispersion. Results on in vivo human data show reduced axon diameter index and better agreement with histology compared to previous methods suggesting improvements in the axon diameter estimate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the degree of axonal damage in relationship to signal abnormalities on T2-weighted high-resolution MRI in spinal cord tissue of patients with MS. METHODS Spinal cord specimens of nine patients with MS and four controls were imaged at high resolution (4.7 T) in an axial plane and scored for lesions with increased signal intensity (SI). Histopathologic sections were cut and immunostained with NE14 (neurofilament marker) and Luxol fast blue (myelin stain). For each area, axonal density and diameter were quantified; axonal irregularity, NE14 axonal staining intensity, and myelin content were semiquantitatively scored. Included were 209 areas from MS cases and 109 areas from control cases distributed over lateral, posterior, and anterior columns. RESULTS In control cases, no SI changes were found, average density of axons was 26,989/mm(2), average diameter was 1.1 micro m, and all scores for axonal irregularity, NE14 staining intensity, and myelin were normal. In MS cases, areas with increased SI were found, average axonal density was 11,807/mm(2) (p {\textless} 0.0001), and average axonal diameter 2.0 micro m (p = 0.001). Areas with high SI on MRI had lowest axonal density (average count: 10,504/mm(2); range: 3,433 to 26,325/mm(2)), largest diameter (average: 2.3 micro m; range: 1.0 to 4.0 micro m), and highest axonal irregularity and NE14 staining intensity compared to normal appearing cord tissue (NACT). However, NACT of MS cases also had lower axonal density (14,158/mm(2)) and higher average axonal diameter (1.6 micro m) than controls. CONCLUSIONS Marked axonal loss occurs in MS spinal cords, largely independent of the degree of signal abnormality on T2-weighted MRI.},

In this study, we focus on fiber orientation dispersion induced by within-voxel fanning. We use a multi-compartment, model-based approach to estimate fiber dispersion. Bingham distributions are employed to represent continuous distributions of fiber orientations, centered around a main orientation, and capturing anisotropic dispersion. We evaluate the accuracy of the model for different simulated fanning geometries, under different acquisition protocols and we illustrate the high SNR and angular resolution needs. We also perform a qualitative comparison between our parametric approach and five popular non-parametric techniques that are based on orientation distribution functions (ODFs). This comparison illustrates how the same underlying geometry can be depicted by different methods. We apply the proposed model on high-quality, post-mortem macaque data and present whole-brain maps of fiber dispersion, as well as exquisite details on the local anatomy of fiber distributions in various white matter regions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. ”Occam's razor” is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set.

abstract = {Two features distinguish the Bayesian approach to learning models from data. First, beliefs derived from background knowledge are used to select a prior probability distribution for the model parameters. Second, predictions of future observations are made by integrating the model's predictions with respect to the posterior parameter distribution obtained by updating this prior to take account of the data. For neural network models, both these aspects present diiculties | the prior over network parameters has no obvious relation to our prior knowledge, and integration over the posterior is computationally very demanding. I address the problem by deening classes of prior distributions for network param-eters that reach sensible limits as the size of the network goes to innnity. In this limit, the properties of these priors can be elucidated. Some priors converge to Gaussian processes, in which functions computed by the network may be smooth, Brownian, or fractionally Brownian. Other priors converge to non-Gaussian stable processes. Interesting eeects are obtained by combining priors of both sorts in networks with more than one hidden layer.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool in the assessment of tissue microstructure. By fitting a model to the dMRI signal it is possible to derive various quantitative features. Several of the most popular dMRI signal models are expansions in an appropriately chosen basis, where the coefficients are determined using some variation of least-squares. However, such approaches lack any notion of uncertainty, which could be valuable in e.g. group analyses. In this work, we use a probabilistic interpretation of linear least-squares methods to recast popular dMRI models as Bayesian ones. This makes it possible to quantify the uncertainty of any derived quantity. In particular, for quantities that are affine functions of the coefficients, the posterior distribution can be expressed in closed-form. We simulated measurements from single- and double-tensor models where the correct values of several quantities are known, to validate that the theoretically derived quantiles agree with those observed empirically. We included results from residual bootstrap for comparison and found good agreement. The validation employed several different models: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Mean Apparent Propagator MRI (MAP-MRI) and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD). We also used in vivo data to visualize maps of quantitative features and corresponding uncertainties, and to show how our approach can be used in a group analysis to downweight subjects with high uncertainty. In summary, we convert successful linear models for dMRI signal estimation to probabilistic models, capable of accurate uncertainty quantification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affymetrix 3' GeneChip microarrays are widely used to profile the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. They differ from many other microarray types in that GeneChips are hybridised using a single labelled extract and because they contain multiple 'match' and 'mismatch' sequences for each transcript. Most algorithms extract the signal from GeneChip experiments in a sequence of separate steps, including background correction and normalisation, which inhibits the simultaneous use of all available information. They principally provide a point estimate of gene expression and, in contrast to BGX, do not fully integrate the uncertainty arising from potentially heterogeneous responses of the probes. RESULTS: BGX is a new Bioconductor R package that implements an integrated Bayesian approach to the analysis of 3' GeneChip data. The software takes into account additive and multiplicative error, non-specific hybridisation and replicate summarisation in the spirit of the model outlined in 1. It also provides a posterior distribution for the expression of each gene. Moreover, BGX can take into account probe affinity effects from probe sequence information where available. The package employs a novel adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that raises considerably the efficiency with which the posterior distributions are sampled from. Finally, BGX incorporates various ways to analyse the results, such as ranking genes by expression level as well as statistically based methods for estimating the amount of up and down regulated genes between two conditions. CONCLUSION: BGX performs well relative to other widely used methods at estimating expression levels and fold changes. It has the advantage that it provides a statistically sound measure of uncertainty for its estimates. BGX includes various analysis functions to visualise and exploit the rich output that is produced by the Bayesian model.},

abstract = {This paper presents Bingham-NODDI, a clinically-feasible technique for estimating the anisotropic orientation dispersion of neurites. Direct quantification of neurite morphology on clinical scanners was recently realised by a diffusion MRI technique known as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). However in its current form NODDI cannot estimate anisotropic orientation dispersion, which is widespread in the brain due to common fanning and bending of neurites. This work proposes Bingham-NODDI that extends the NODDI formalism to address this limitation. Bingham-NODDI characterises anisotropic orientation dispersion by utilising the Bingham distribution to model neurite orientation distribution. The new model estimates the extent of dispersion about the dominant orientation, separately along the primary and secondary dispersion orientations. These estimates are subsequently used to estimate the overall dispersion about the dominant orientation and the dispersion anisotropy. We systematically evaluate the ability of the new model to recover these key parameters of anisotropic orientation dispersion with standard NODDI protocol, both in silico and in vivo. The results demonstrate that the parameters of the proposed model can be estimated without additional acquisition requirements over the standard NODDI protocol. Thus anisotropic dispersion can be determined and has the potential to be used as a marker for normal brain development and ageing or in pathology. We additionally find that the original NODDI model is robust to the effects of anisotropic orientation dispersion, when the quantification of anisotropic dispersion is not of interest.},

Boolean networks have been used successfully in modeling gene regulatory networks. In the Boolean network model, the transcriptional state of each gene is represented by 0 (inactive) or 1 (active), and the relationship among genes is represented by logical gates updated at discrete time points. However, the Boolean gene states are never observed directly, but only indirectly and incompletely through noisy measurements based on expression technologies such as cDNA microarrays, RNA-Seq, and cell imaging-based assays. The Partially-Observed Boolean Dynamical System (POBDS) signal model is distinct from other deterministic and stochastic Boolean network models in removing the requirement of a directly observable Boolean state vector and allowing uncertainty in the measurement process, addressing the scenario encountered in practice in transcriptomic analysis. 
                           BoolFilter is an R package that implements the POBDS model and associated algorithms for state and parameter estimation. It allows the user to estimate the Boolean states, network topology, and measurement parameters from time series of transcriptomic data using exact and approximated (particle) filters, as well as simulate the transcriptomic data for a given Boolean network model. Some of its infrastructure, such as the network interface, is the same as in the previously published R package for Boolean Networks BoolNet, which enhances compatibility and user accessibility to the new package. We introduce the R package BoolFilter for Partially-Observed Boolean Dynamical Systems (POBDS). The BoolFilter package provides a useful toolbox for the bioinformatics community, with state-of-the-art algorithms for simulation of time series transcriptomic data as well as the inverse process of system identification from data obtained with various expression technologies such as cDNA microarrays, RNA-Seq, and cell imaging-based assays.},

This technique is applied to the estimation of parameters in the diffusion tensor model, and also to a simple partial volume model of diffusion. In both cases the parameters of interest include parameters defining local fiber direction. A technique is then presented for using these density functions to estimate global connectivity (i.e., the probability of the existence of a connection through the data field, between any two distant points), allowing for the quantification of belief in tractography results. This technique is then applied to the estimation of the cortical connectivity of the human thalamus.

abstract = {Recent technological progress in the multiband echo planer imaging (MB EPI) technique enables accelerated MR diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and allows whole brain, multi-b-value diffusion imaging to be acquired within a clinically feasible time. However, its applications at 7 T have been limited due to B1 field inhomogeneity and increased susceptibility artifact. It is an ongoing debate whether DWI at 7 T can be performed properly in patients, and a systematic SNR comparison for multiband spin-echo EPI between 3 T and 7 T has not been methodically studied. The goal of this study was to use MB EPI at 7 T in order to obtain 90-directional multi-shell DWI within a clinically feasible acquisition time for patients with glioma. This study included an SNR comparison between 3 T and 7 T, and the application of B1 mapping and distortion correction procedures for reducing the impact of variations in B0 and B1. The optimized multiband sequence was applied in 20 patients with glioma to generate both DTI and NODDI maps for comparison of values in tumor and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Our SNR analysis showed that MB EPI at 7 T was comparable to that at 3 T, and the data quality acquired in patients was clinically acceptable. NODDI maps provided unique contrast within the T2 lesion that was not seen in anatomical images or DTI maps. Such contrast may reflect the complexity of tissue compositions associated with disease progression and treatment effects. The ability to consistently obtain high quality diffusion data at 7 T will contribute towards the implementation of a comprehensive brain MRI examination at ultra-high field.},

abstract = {Tractography is a class of algorithms aiming at in vivo mapping the major neuronal pathways in the white matter from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. These techniques offer a powerful tool to noninvasively investigate at the macroscopic scale the architecture of the neuronal connections of the brain. However, unfortunately, the reconstructions recovered with existing tractography algorithms are not really quantitative even though diffusion MRI is a quantitative modality by nature. As a matter of fact, several techniques have been proposed in recent years to estimate, at the voxel level, intrinsic microstructural features of the tissue, such as axonal density and diameter, by using multicompartment models. In this paper, we present a novel framework to reestablish the link between tractography and tissue microstructure. Starting from an input set of candidate fiber-tracts, which are estimated from the data using standard fiber-tracking techniques, we model the diffusion MRI signal in each voxel of the image as a linear combination of the restricted and hindered contributions generated in every location of the brain by these candidate tracts. Then, we seek for the global weight of each of them, i.e., the effective contribution or volume, such that they globally fit the measured signal at best. We demonstrate that these weights can be easily recovered by solving a global convex optimization problem and using efficient algorithms. The effectiveness of our approach has been evaluated both on a realistic phantom with known ground-truth and in vivo brain data. Results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed formulation, opening new perspectives for a more quantitative and biologically plausible assessment of the structural connectivity of the brain.},

abstract = {This paper aims to identify the minimum requirements for an accurate model of the diffusion MR signal in white matter of the brain. We construct a taxonomy of multi-compartment models of white matter from combinations of simple models for the intra- and the extra-axonal spaces. We devise a new diffusion MRI protocol that provides measurements with a wide range of imaging parameters for diffusion sensitization both parallel and perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the protocol to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows us to fit, study and compare the different models. The study examines a total of 47 analytic models, including several well-used models from the literature, which we place within the taxonomy. The results show that models that incorporate intra-axonal restriction, such as ball and stick or CHARMED, generally explain the data better than those that do not, such as the DT or the biexponential models. However, three-compartment models which account for restriction parallel to the axons and incorporate pore size explain the measurements most accurately. The best fit comes from combining a full diffusion tensor (DT) model of the extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal component of single radius and a third spherical compartment of non-zero radius. We also measure the stability of the non-zero radius intra-axonal models and find that single radius intra-axonal models are more stable than gamma distributed radii models with similar fitting performance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) offers huge promise to accelerate a range of computationally intensive benchmarks. Quantum com-puting is limited, however, by the challenges of decoherence: i.e., a quantum state can only be maintained for short windows of time be-fore it decoheres. While quantum error correction codes can protect against decoherence, fast execution time is the best defense against decoherence, so efficient architectures and effective scheduling al-gorithms are necessary. This paper proposes the Multi-SIMD QC architecture and then proposes and evaluates effective schedulers to map benchmark descriptions onto Multi-SIMD architectures. The Multi-SIMD model consists of a small number of SIMD regions, each of which may support operations on up to thousands of qubits per cycle. Efficient Multi-SIMD operation requires efficient scheduling. This work develops schedulers to reduce communication require-ments of qubits between operating regions, while also improving parallelism.We find that communication to global memory is a dominant cost in QC. We also note that many quantum benchmarks have long serial operation paths (although each operation may be data parallel). To exploit this characteristic, we introduce Longest-Path-First Scheduling (LPFS) which pins operations to SIMD re-gions to keep data in-place and reduce communication to memory. The use of small, local scratchpad memories also further reduces communication. Our results show a 3{\%} to 308{\%} improvement for LPFS over conventional scheduling algorithms, and an additional 3{\%} to 64{\%} improvement using scratchpad memories. Our work is the most comprehensive software-to-quantum toolflow published to date, with efficient and practical scheduling techniques that re-duce communication and increase parallelism for full-scale quan-tum code executing up to a trillion quantum gate operations.},

When it is possible to draw from each full-conditional distribution associated with the target this is just a Gibbs sampler. Often at least one of the Gibbs updates is replaced with a Metropolis–Hastings step, yielding a Metropolis–Hastings-within-Gibbs al-gorithm. Strategies for combining component-wise updates include compo-sition, random sequence and random scans. While these strategies can ease MCMC implementation and produce superior empirical performance com-pared to full-dimensional updates, the theoretical convergence properties of the associated Markov chains have received limited attention. We present conditions under which some component-wise Markov chains converge to the stationary distribution at a geometric rate. We pay particular attention to the connections between the convergence rates of the various component-wise strategies. This is important since it ensures the existence of tools that an MCMC practitioner can use to be as confident in the simulation results as if they were based on independent and identically distributed samples. We illustrate our results in two examples including a hierarchical linear mixed model and one involving maximum likelihood estimation for mixed models.},

abstract = {During the last decade, many approaches have been proposed for improving the estimation of diffusion measures. These techniques have already shown an increase in accuracy based on theoretical considerations, such as incorporating prior knowledge of the data distribution. The increased accuracy of diffusion metric estimators is typically observed in well-defined simulations, where the assumptions regarding properties of the data distribution are known to be valid. In practice, however, correcting for subject motion and geometric eddy current deformations alters the data distribution tremendously such that it can no longer be expressed in a closed form. The image processing steps that precede the model fitting will render several assumptions on the data distribution invalid, potentially nullifying the benefit of applying more advanced diffusion estimators. In this work, we present a generic diffusion model fitting framework that considers some statistics of diffusion MRI data. A central role in the framework is played by the conditional least squares estimator. We demonstrate that the accuracy of that particular estimator can generally be preserved, regardless the applied preprocessing steps, if the noise parameter is known a priori. To fulfill that condition, we also propose an approach for the estimation of spatially varying noise levels.},

abstract = {A computational framework to obtain an accurate quantification of the Gaussian and non-Gaussian component of water molecules' diffusion through brain tissues with diffusion kurtosis imaging, is presented. The diffusion kurtosis imaging model quantifies the kurtosis, the degree of non-Gaussianity, on a direction dependent basis, constituting a higher order diffusion kurtosis tensor, which is estimated in addition to the well-known diffusion tensor. To reconcile with the physical phenomenon of molecular diffusion, both tensor estimates should lie within a physically acceptable range. Otherwise, clinically and artificially significant changes in diffusion (kurtosis) parameters might be confounded. To guarantee physical relevance, we here suggest to estimate both diffusional tensors by maximizing the joint likelihood function of all Rician distributed diffusion weighted images given the diffusion kurtosis imaging model while imposing a set of nonlinear constraints. As shown in this study, correctly accounting for the Rician noise structure is necessary to avoid significant overestimation of the kurtosis values. The performance of the constrained estimator was evaluated and compared to more commonly used strategies during simulations. Human brain data were used to emphasize the need for constrained estimators as not imposing the constraints give rise to constraint violations in about 70{\%} of the brain voxels.},

abstract = {We developed Convis, a Python simulation toolbox for large scale neural populations which offers arbitrary receptive fields by 1D, 2D and 3D convolutions executed on a graphics card. The resulting software proves to be flexible and easily extensible in Python, while building on the PyTorch library, which was previously used successfully in deep learning applications, for just-in-time optimization and compilation of the model onto CPU or GPU architectures. An alternative implementation based on Theano is also available, although not fully supported. Through automatic differentiation, any parameter of a specified model can be optimized to approach a desired output which is a significant improvement over e.g. Monte Carlo or particle optimizations without gradients. We show that a number of models including even complex non-linearities such as contrast gain control and spiking mechanisms can be implemented easily. We show in this paper that we can in particular recreate the simulation results of a popular retina simulation software VirtualRetina (Wohrer and Kornprobst, 2009), with the added benefit of providing (1) arbitrary linear filters instead of the product of Gaussian and exponential filters and (2) optimization routines utilizing the gradients of the model. We demonstrate the utility of 3d convolution filters with a simple direction selective filter. Also we show that it is possible to optimize the input for a certain goal, rather than the parameters, which can aid the design of experiments as well as closed-loop online stimulus generation. Yet, Convis is more than a retina simulator. For instance it can also predict the response of V1 orientation selective cells.

abstract = {The ultimate promise of diffusion MRI (dMRI) models is specificity to neuronal microstructure, which may lead to distinct clinical biomarkers using noninvasive imaging. While multi-compartment models are a common approach to interpret water diffusion in the brain in vivo, the estimation of their parameters from the dMRI signal remains an unresolved problem. Practically, even when q space is highly oversampled, nonlinear fit outputs suffer from heavy bias and poor precision. So far, this has been alleviated by fixing some of the model parameters to a priori values, for improved precision at the expense of accuracy. Here we use a representative two-compartment model to show that fitting fails to determine the five model parameters from over 60 measurement points. For the first time, we identify the reasons for this poor performance. The first reason is the existence of two local minima in the parameter space for the objective function of the fitting procedure. These minima correspond to qualitatively different sets of parameters, yet they both lie within biophysically plausible ranges. We show that, at realistic signal-to-noise ratio values, choosing between the two minima based on the associated objective function values is essentially impossible. Second, there is an ensemble of very low objective function values around each of these minima in the form of a pipe. The existence of such a direction in parameter space, along which the objective function profile is very flat, explains the bias and large uncertainty in parameter estimation, and the spurious parameter correlations: in the presence of noise, the minimum can be randomly displaced by a very large amount along each pipe. Our results suggest that the biophysical interpretation of dMRI model parameters crucially depends on establishing which of the minima is closer to the biophysical reality and the size of the uncertainty associated with each parameter.

We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

This has led to the development of 2D graphical methods for representing fiber orientation and DT-MRI "tractography," which aims to reconstruct the 3D trajectories of white matter fasciculi. Most contemporary fiber orientation mapping schemes and tractography algorithms employ the directional information contained in the eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor to approximate white matter fiber orientation. However, while the uncertainty associated with every estimate of an eigenvector has long been recognized, no attempts to quantify this uncertainty in vivo have been reported. Here, a method is proposed for determining confidence intervals in fiber orientation from real DT-MRI data using the bootstrap method. This is used to construct maps of the "cone of uncertainty," allowing simultaneous viewing of fiber orientation and its uncertainty, and to examine the relationship between orientation uncertainty and tissue anisotropy.},

Particularly, by using the differential equation method, some general analytical expressions of any sth derivatives with respect to single parameter can be deduced by induction in s. Moreover, we can obtain all the mixed derivatives of higher order very conveniently. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of these derivatives in mathematics, physics and other related fields. Numerical examples for computing those singular oscillatory integrals presented in Kang et al.

abstract = {THE transport of fluids in porous media is of importance in a wide range of areas, such as oil recovery, heterogeneous catalysis and biological perfusion. The pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR technique has been used for many years to characterize diffusion and flow in such systems1–3. The analogy between NMR measurements in a field gradient and diffraction has been pointed out in the context of NMR imaging4 and, more recently, diffraction-like effects in the PGSE experiment have been discussed for diffusion in both impermeable5 and connected6 structures. The gradient pulse area plays the role of a wavevector, q, which can probe the structure in which the fluid diffuses. Here we report experimental confirmation of these predicted effects from proton NMR studies of a water-saturated, orientationally disordered, loosely packed array of monodisperse polystyrene spheres. The PGSE-NMR experiments may thus be used to provide an indirect, averaged image of the internal structure of porous solids at a resolution higher than that achievable with conventional NMR imaging. This is particularly advantageous for measurements on large samples, as the resolution available with the PGSE method depends only on the available range of gradient pulse amplitude and duration and is unconstrained by the factors determining resolution in conventional NMR imaging.},

The theory for glasslike media is then used to analyze experimental PGSE NMR data for a water‐saturated random loose pack of nearly monodisperse polystyrene spheres. The structural parameters extracted by this method are consistent with the known geometry of such packings.

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to characterize white matter in health and disease. Previous approaches to the estimation of diffusion tensors have either been statistically suboptimal or have used Gaussian approximations of the underlying noise structure, which is Rician in reality. This can cause quantities derived from these tensors - e.g., fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient - to diverge from their true values, potentially leading to artifactual changes that confound clinically significant ones. This paper presents a novel maximum likelihood approach to tensor estimation, denoted diffusion tensor estimation by maximizing Rician likelihood (DTEMRL). In contrast to previous approaches, DTEMRL considers the joint distribution of all observed data in the context of an augmented tensor model to account for variable levels of Rician noise. To improve numeric stability and prevent non-physical solutions, DTEMRL incorporates a robust characterization of positive definite tensors and a new estimator of underlying noise variance. In simulated and clinical data, mean squared error metrics show consistent and significant improvements from low clinical SNR to high SNR. DTEMRL may be readily supplemented with spatial regularization or a priori tensor distributions for Bayesian tensor estimation.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become one of the most popular MRI techniques in brain research, as well as in clinical practice. The number of brain studies with DTI is growing steadily and, over the last decade, has produced more than 700 publications. Diffusion tensor imaging enables visualization and characterization of white matter fascicli in two and three dimensions. Since the introduction of this methodology in 1994, it has been used to study the white matter architecture and integrity of the normal and diseased brains (multiple sclerosis, stroke, aging, dementia, schizophrenia, etc.). Although it provided image contrast that was not available with routine MR techniques, unique information on white matter and 3D visualization of neuronal pathways, many questions were raised regarding the origin of the DTI signal. Diffusion tensor imaging is constantly validated, challenged, and developed in terms of acquisition scheme, image processing, analysis, and interpretation. While DTI offers a powerful tool to study and visualize white matter, it suffers from inherent artifacts and limitations. The partial volume effect and the inability of the model to cope with non-Gaussian diffusion are its two main drawbacks. Nevertheless, when combined with functional brain mapping, DTI provides an efficient tool for comprehensive, noninvasive, functional anatomy mapping of the human brain. This review summarizes the development of DTI in the last decade with respect to the specificity and utility of the technique in radiology and anatomy studies.},

The diffusion of water molecules in brain tissue, most fully expressed mathematically by a tensor quantity, reflects its intrinsic microstructure. It is now possible to estimate the diffusion tensor noninvasively in the human brain using MR DTI. This method is unique in providing precise and rotationally invariant measurements of the amount and directional bias (anisotropy) of diffusion in white matter tracts relating to tissue integrity and orientation.$\backslash$nMethods: DTI was performed in six patients with MS and in six age-matched control subjects. Diffusion was characterized in normal-appearing white matter in both groups, and in lesions of different pathologic subtypes (inflammatory, noninflammatory, T1 hypointense, and T1 isointense).$\backslash$nResults: DTI identified significantly altered water diffusion properties in the normal-appearing white matter of patients compared with control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001), and distinguished between lesion types. The highest diffusion was seen in destructive (T1 hypointense) lesions, whereas the greatest change in anisotropy was found in inflammatory (gadolinium-enhancing) lesions.$\backslash$nConclusions: DTI detects diffuse abnormalities in the normal-appearing white matter of MS patients, and the findings in lesions appear to relate to pathologic severity. Its use in serial studies and in larger clinical cohorts may increase our understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of reversible and persistent disability.},

This review focuses on the changes in DTI parameters which accompany both brain maturation and injury. The two primary pieces of information available from DTI studies-water apparent diffusion coefficient and diffusion anisotropy measures-change dramatically during development, reflecting underlying changes in tissue water content and cytoarchitecture. DTI parameters also change in response to brain injury. In this context, not only does DTI offer the possibility of detecting injury earlier than conventional imaging methods, but also appears more sensitive to disruption of white matter than any other imaging method. DTI offers unique insight into brain injury and maturation, and does so in a fashion that can be readily applied in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {A magnetic resonance imaging method is presented for quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter, reflecting the structural differences between these two types of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

abstract = {Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in five countries and three continents, which is still growing.},

abstract = {The central nervous system is composed of many individual units - from cells to areas - that are connected with one another in a complex pattern of functional interactions that supports perception, action, and cognition. One natural and parsimonious representation of such a system is a graph in which nodes (units) are connected by edges (interactions). While applicable across spatiotemporal scales, species, and cohorts, the traditional graph approach is unable to address the complexity of time-varying connectivity patterns that may be critically important for an understanding of emotional and cognitive state, task-switching, adaptation and development, or aging and disease progression. Here we survey a set of tools from applied mathematics that offer measures to characterize dynamic graphs. Along with this survey, we offer suggestions for visualization and a publicly-available MATLAB toolbox to facilitate the application of these metrics to existing or yet-to-be acquired neuroimaging data. We illustrate the toolbox by applying it to a previously published data set of time-varying functional graphs, but note that the tools can also be applied to time-varying structural graphs or to other sorts of relational data entirely. Our aim is to provide the neuroimaging community with a useful set of tools, and an intuition regarding how to use them, for addressing emerging questions that hinge on accurate and creative analyses of dynamic graphs.},

abstract = {The Effective Sample Size (ESS) is an important measure of efficiency of Monte Carlo methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Importance Sampling (IS) techniques. In the IS context, an approximation ESS{\^{}} of the theoretical ESS definition is widely applied, involving the inverse of the sum of the squares of the normalized importance weights. This formula, ESS{\^{}}, has become an essential piece within Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, to assess the convenience of a resampling step. From another perspective, the expression ESS{\^{}} is related to the Euclidean distance between the probability mass described by the normalized weights and the discrete uniform probability mass function (pmf). In this work, we derive other possible ESS functions based on different discrepancy measures between these two pmfs. Several examples are provided involving, for instance, the geometric mean of the weights, the discrete entropy (including the perplexity measure, already proposed in literature) and the Gini coefficient among others. We list five theoretical requirements which a generic ESS function should satisfy, allowing us to classify different ESS measures. We also compare the most promising ones by means of numerical simulations.},

abstract = {We evaluate residual aliasing among simultaneously excited and acquired slices in slice accelerated multiband (MB) echo planar imaging (EPI). No in-plane accelerations were used in order to maximize and evaluate achievable slice acceleration factors at 3. T. We propose a novel leakage (L-) factor to quantify the effects of signal leakage between simultaneously acquired slices. With a standard 32-channel receiver coil at 3. T, we demonstrate that slice acceleration factors of up to eight (MB = 8) with blipped controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI), in the absence of in-plane accelerations, can be used routinely with acceptable image quality and integrity for whole brain imaging. Spectral analyses of single-shot fMRI time series demonstrate that temporal fluctuations due to both neuronal and physiological sources were distinguishable and comparable up to slice-acceleration factors of nine (MB = 9). The increased temporal efficiency could be employed to achieve, within a given acquisition period, higher spatial resolution, increased fMRI statistical power, multiple TEs, faster sampling of temporal events in a resting state fMRI time series, increased sampling of q-space in diffusion imaging, or more quiet time during a scan. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We use a distance metric to compare streamlines in a subject dataset to labeled centroids in the atlas, and label them using a per-bundle configurable threshold. In order to reduce segmentation time, the algorithm first preprocesses the data using a simplified distance metric to rapidly discard candidate streamlines in multiple stages, while guaranteeing that no false negatives are produced. The smaller set of remaining streamlines is then segmented using the original metric, thus eliminating any false positives from the preprocessing stage. As a result, a single-thread implementation of the algorithm can segment a dataset of almost 9 million streamlines in less than 6 minutes. Moreover, parallel versions of our algorithm for multicore processors and graphics processing units further reduce the segmentation time to less than 22 seconds and to 5 seconds, respectively. This performance enables the use of the algorithm in truly interactive applications for visualization, analysis, and segmentation of large white matter tractography datasets.},

abstract = {An automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into brain and non-brain has been developed. It is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of MR sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool (BET), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against "gold-standard" hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods.},

abstract = {The densities of fibers of different sizes were calculated in ten regions of the corpus callosum of twenty human brains (ten females, ten males). Light microscopic examination revealed a consistent pattern of regional differentiation of fiber types in the corpus callosum. Thin fibers are most dense in the anterior corpus callosum (genu), and decrease in density posteriorly towards the posterior midbody, where they reach a minimum. Towards the posterior corpus callosum (splenium), the density of thin fibers increases again, but in the posterior pole of the callosum the density decreases locally. Large-diameter fibers show a pattern complementary to that of thin fibers, having a peak of density in the posterior midbody and a local increase of density in the posterior pole of the corpus callosum. Across subjects, the overall density of callosal fibers had no significant correlation with callosal area and an increased callosal area indicated an increased total number of fibers crossing through. Considering different fiber sizes, this was only true for small diameter fibers, whose large majority is believed to interconnect association cortex. No sex differences in fiber composition of the corpus callosum were found.},

abstract = {This article discusses general modeling of multisubject and/or multisession FMRI data. In particular, we show that a two-level mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated from parameter and variance estimates from the single-session level) can be made equivalent to a single complete mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated directly from all of the original single sessions' time series data) if the (co-)variance at the second level is set equal to the sum of the (co-)variances in the single-level form, using the BLUE with known covariances. This result has significant implications for group studies in FMRI, since it shows that the group analysis requires only values of the parameter estimates and their (co-)variance from the first level, generalizing the well-established "summary statistics" approach in FMRI. The simple and generalized framework allows different prewhitening and different first-level regressors to be used for each subject. The framework incorporates multiple levels and cases such as repeated measures, paired or unpaired t tests and F tests at the group level; explicit examples of such models are given in the article. Using numerical simulations based on typical first-level covariance structures from real FMRI data we demonstrate that by taking into account lower-level covariances and heterogeneity a substantial increase in higher-level Z score is possible. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Global fiber reconstruction aims at providing a consistent view of the fiber architecture in the whole volume of cerebral white matter on the basis of diffusion-sensitized magnetic resonance imaging. A new realization of this principle is presented. The method utilizes data acquired with high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), a measurement method that fulfills clinical requirements. For the first time among global reconstruction methods, the computation time is acceptable for a broad class of practical applications. The method does not involve any boundary conditions that prescribe the location of the ends of reconstructed fibers. This helps to minimize necessary user interaction and operator dependence. Results obtained in a physical phantom demonstrate a high reconstruction quality. In vivo results have been obtained in several volunteers. The algorithm found a number of prominent fascicles including those in the limbic system, which had been problematic for a previously published version of global tracking. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The property of Harris recurrence allows us to replace ``almost all'' by ``all,'' which is potentially important when running Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Full-dimensional Metropolis--Hastings algorithms are known to be Harris recurrent. In this paper, we consider conditions under which Metropolis-within-Gibbs and trans-dimensional Markov chains are or are not Harris recurrent. We present a simple but natural two-dimensional counter-example showing how Harris recurrence can fail, and also a variety of positive results which guarantee Harris recurrence. We also present some open problems. We close with a discussion of the practical implications for MCMC algorithms.},

abstract = {High resolution diffusion tensor imaging and tractography of ex vivo brain specimens has the potential to reveal detailed fibre architecture not visible on in vivo images. Previous ex vivo diffusion imaging experiments have focused on animal brains or small sections of human tissue since the unfavourable properties of fixed tissue (including short T2 and low diffusion rates) demand the use of very powerful gradient coils that are too small to accommodate a whole, human brain. This study proposes the use of diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) as a method of extending the benefits of ex vivo DTI and tractography to whole, human, fixed brains on a clinical 3??T scanner. DW-SSFP is a highly efficient pulse sequence; however, its complicated signal dependence precludes the use of standard diffusion tensor analysis and tractography. In this study, a method is presented for modelling anisotropy in the context of DW-SSFP. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to estimate the posterior distributions of model parameters and it is shown that it is possible to estimate a tight distribution on the principal axis of diffusion at each voxel using DW-SSFP. Voxel-wise estimates are used to perform tractography in a whole, fixed human brain. A direct comparison between 3D diffusion-weighted spin echo EPI and 3D DW-SSFP-EPI reveals that the orientation of the principal diffusion axis can be inferred on with a higher degree of certainty using a 3D DW-SSFP-EPI even with a 68{\%} shorter acquisition time. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

When interest focuses on quantiles of functionals of the posterior distribution, we describe an easily-implemented method for determining the total number of iterations required, and also the number of initial iterations that should be discarded to allow for "burn-in". The method uses only the Gibbs iterates themselves, and does not, for example, require external specification of characteristics of the posterior density. Here the method is described for the situation where one long run is generated, but it can also be easily applied if there are several runs from different starting points. It also applies more generally to Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes other than the Gibbs sampler. It can also be used when several quantiles are to be estimated, when the quantities of interest are probabilities rather than full posterior distributions, and when the draws from the posterior distribution are required to be approximately independent. The method is applied to several different posterior distributions. These include},

abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the influence of transcytolemmal water exchange on estimates of tissue microstructural parameters derived from diffusion MRI using conventional PGSE and IMPULSED methods. METHODS Computer simulations were performed to incorporate a broad range of intracellular water life times {\$}\tau{\$}in (50-∞ ms), cell diameters d (5-15 {\$}\mu{\$}m), and intrinsic diffusion coefficient Din (0.6-2 {\$}\mu{\$}m(2) /ms) for different values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (10 to 50). For experiments, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cancer cells were cultured and treated with saponin to selectively change cell membrane permeability. All fitted microstructural parameters from simulations and experiments in vitro were compared with ground-truth values. RESULTS Simulations showed that, for both PGSE and IMPULSED methods, cell diameter d can be reliably fit with sufficient SNR (≥ 50), whereas intracellular volume fraction fin is intrinsically underestimated due to transcytolemmal water exchange. Din can be reliably fit only with sufficient SNR and using the IMPULSED method with short diffusion times. These results were confirmed with those obtained in the cell culture experiments in vitro. CONCLUSION For the sequences and models considered in this study, transcytolemmal water exchange has minor effects on the fittings of d and Din with physiologically relevant membrane permeabilities if the SNR is sufficient ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 50), but fin is intrinsically underestimated.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion provides microstructural indices that are potentially more specific than those from diffusion tensor imaging. However, in comparison to diffusion tensor imaging, the acquisition time is longer, limiting clinical applications. Moreover, the model requires several parameters to be estimated whose confidence intervals can be large. Here, the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion acquisition and data processing pipelines are optimized to extend the utility of this approach. METHODS: A multishell sampling scheme was optimized using the electrostatic repulsion algorithm, combined with optimal ordering. The optimal protocol, using as few measurements as possible, was determined through leave-n-out analyses. Parsimonious model selection criteria were used to select between nested models, comprising up to three restricted compartments. The schemes were evaluated using both through Monte-Carlo simulations and in vivo data. RESULTS: The optimization/model selection procedure resulted in increased accuracy and precision on the estimated parameters, allowing for a reduction in acquisition time and marked improvements in data quality. The final protocol provided whole brain coverage data in only 12 min. CONCLUSION: Through careful optimization of the acquisition and analysis pipeline for the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion, it is possible to reduce acquisition time for whole brain datasets to a time that is clinically applicable.

abstract = {Here, we present the first in vivo non-invasive measurement of the axon diameter distribution in the rat corpus callosum. Previously, this measurement was only possible using invasive histological methods. The axon diameter, along with other physical properties, such as the intra-axonal resistance, membrane resistance and capacitance etc. helps determine many important functional properties of nerves, such as their conduction velocity. In this work, we provide a novel magnetic resonance imaging method called AxCaliber, which can resolve the distinct signatures of trapped water molecules diffusing within axons as well as water molecules diffusing freely within the extra-axonal space. Using a series of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, we can reliably infer both the distribution of axon diameters and the volume fraction of these axons within each white matter voxel. We were able to verify the known microstructural variation along the corpus callosum of the rat from the anterior (genu) to posterior (splenium) regions. AxCaliber yields a narrow distribution centered approximately 1 microm in the genu and splenium and much broader distributions centered approximately 3 microm in the body of the corpus callosum. The axon diameter distribution found by AxCaliber is generally broader than those usually obtained by histology. One factor contributing to this difference is the significant tissue shrinkage that results from histological preparation. To that end, AxCaliber might provide a better estimate of the in vivo morphology of white matter. Being a magnetic resonance imaging based methodology, AxCaliber has the potential to be used in human scanners for morphological studies of white matter in normal and abnormal development, and white matter related diseases.},

abstract = {Axonal density and diameter are two fundamental properties of brain white matter. Recently, advanced diffusion MRI techniques have made these two parameters accessible in vivo. However, the techniques available to estimate such parameters are still under development. For example, current methods to map axonal diameters capture relative trends over different structures, but consistently over-estimate absolute diameters. Axonal density estimates are more accessible experimentally, but different modeling approaches exist and the impact of the experimental parameters has not been thoroughly quantified, potentially leading to incompatibility of results obtained in different studies using different techniques. Here, we characterise the impact of diffusion time on axonal density and diameter estimates using Monte Carlo simulations and STEAM diffusion MRI at 7 T on 9 healthy volunteers. We show that axonal density and diameter estimates strongly depend on diffusion time, with diameters almost invariably overestimated and density both over and underestimated for some commonly used models. Crucially, we also demonstrate that these biases are reduced when the model accounts for diffusion time dependency in the extra-axonal space. For axonal density estimates, both upward and downward bias in different situations are removed by modeling extra-axonal time-dependence, showing increased accuracy in these estimates. For axonal diameter estimates, we report increased accuracy in ground truth simulations and axonal diameter estimates decreased away from high values given by earlier models and towards known values in the human corpus callosum when modeling extra-axonal time-dependence. Axonal diameter feasibility under both advanced and clinical settings is discussed in the light of the proposed advances.},

abstract = {The statistical properties of background noise such as its standard deviation and mean value are frequently used to estimate the original noise level of the acquired data. This requires the knowledge of the statistical intensity distribution of the background signal, that is, the probability density of the occurrence of a certain signal intensity. The influence of many new MRI techniques and, in particular, of various parallel-imaging methods on the noise statistics has neither been rigorously investigated nor experimentally demonstrated yet. In this study, the statistical distribution of background noise was analyzed for MR acquisitions with a single-channel and a 32-channel coil, with sum-of-squares (SoS) and spatial-matched-filter (SMF) data combination, with and without parallel imaging using k-space and image-domain algorithms, with real-part and conventional magnitude reconstruction and with several reconstruction filters. Depending on the imaging technique, the background noise could be described by a Rayleigh distribution, a noncentral $\chi$-distribution or the positive half of a Gaussian distribution. In particular, the noise characteristics of SoS-reconstructed multichannel acquisitions (with k-space-based parallel imaging or without parallel imaging) differ substantially from those with image-domain parallel imaging or SMF combination. These effects must be taken into account if mean values or standard deviations of background noise are employed for data analysis such as determination of local noise levels. Assuming a Rayleigh distribution as in conventional MR images or a noncentral $\chi$-distribution for all multichannel acquisitions is invalid in general and may lead to erroneous estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio or the contrast-to-noise ratio. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Biexponential, kurtosis, stretched exponential, and monoexponential models were ranked using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) with validation by a leave-one-out test of model prediction error.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For unfixed tissue measurements (b-value range: 17-2104 s/mm(2) ) the biexponential and kurtosis models had similar information content to each other and this was distinctly higher than for the stretched and monoexponential models. In fixed-tissue measurements (b-value range: 17-8252 s/mm(2) ), the biexponential model had much higher information content than the three other models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: AIC-based model ranking is consistent with an independent prediction accuracy test. Biexponential and kurtosis models consistently perform better than stretched and monoexponential models.

@article{Jeurissen2013,
abstract = {It has long been recognized that the diffusion tensor model is inappropriate to characterize complex fiber architecture, causing tensor-derived measures such as the primary eigenvector and fractional anisotropy to be unreliable or misleading in these regions. There is however still debate about the impact of this problem in practice. A recent study using a Bayesian automatic relevance detection (ARD) multicompartment model suggested that a third of white matter (WM) voxels contain crossing fibers, a value that, whilst already significant, is likely to be an underestimate. The aim of this study is to provide more robust estimates of the proportion of affected voxels, the number of fiber orientations within each WM voxel, and the impact on tensor-derived analyses, using large, high-quality diffusion-weighted data sets, with reconstruction parameters optimized specifically for this task. Two reconstruction algorithms were used: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and the ARD method used in the previous study. We estimate the proportion of WM voxels containing crossing fibers to be {\~{}}90{\%} (using CSD) and 63{\%} (using ARD). Both these values are much higher than previously reported, strongly suggesting that the diffusion tensor model is inadequate in the vast majority of WM regions. This has serious implications for downstream processing applications that depend on this model, particularly tractography, and the interpretation of anisotropy and radial/axial diffusivity measures.},

Bundle adjustment involves the formulation of a large scale, yet sparse minimization problem, which is traditionally solved using a sparse variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm that avoids storing and operating on zero entries. This paper argues that considerable computational benefits can be gained by substituting the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the implementation of bundle adjustment with a sparse variant of Powell's dog leg non-linear least squares technique.

abstract = {Here we address an important issue that has been embedded within the neuroimaging community for a long time: the absence of effect estimates in results reporting in the literature. The statistic value itself, as a dimensionless measure, does not provide information on the biophysical interpretation of a study, and it certainly does not represent the whole picture of a study. Unfortunately, in contrast to standard practice in most scientific fields, effect (or amplitude) estimates are usually not provided in most results reporting in the current neuroimaging publications and presentations. Possible reasons underlying this general trend include: 1) lack of general awareness, 2) software limitations, 3) inaccurate estimation of the BOLD response, and 4) poor modeling due to our relatively limited understanding of FMRI signal components. However, as we discuss here, such reporting damages the reliability and interpretability of the scientific findings themselves, and there is in fact no overwhelming reason for such a practice to persist. In order to promote meaningful interpretation, cross validation, reproducibility, meta and power analyses in neuroimaging, we strongly suggest that, as part of good scientific practice, effect estimates should be reported together with their corresponding statistic values. We provide several easily adaptable recommendations for facilitating this process.},

@inproceedings{Yap2015,
abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) is a powerful imaging modality due to its unique ability to extract microstructural information by utilizing restricted diffusion to probe compartments that are much smaller than the voxel size. Quite commonly, a mixture of models is fitted to the data to infer microstructural properties based on the estimated parameters. The fitting process is often non-linear and computationally very intensive. Recent work by Daducci et al. has shown that speed improvement of several orders of magnitude can be achieved by linearizing and recasting the fitting problem as a linear system, involving the estimation of the volume fractions associated with a set of diffusion basis functions that span the signal space. However, to ensure coverage of the signal space, sufficiently dense sampling of the parameter space is needed. This can be problematic because the number of basis functions increases exponentially with the number of parameters, causing computational intractability. We propose in this paper a method called iterative subspace screening (ISS) for tackling this ultrahigh dimensional problem. ISS requires only solving the problem in a medium-size subspace with a dimension that is much smaller than the original space spanned by all diffusion basis functions but is larger than the expected cardinality of the support of the solution. The solution obtained for this subspace is used to screen the basis functions to identify a new subspace that is pertinent to the target problem. These steps are performed iteratively to seek both the solution subspace and the solution itself. We apply ISS to the estimation of the fiber orientation distribution function (ODF) and demonstrate that it improves estimation robustness and accuracy.},

abstract = {Optimization algorithms are becoming increasingly more important in many areas, such as finance and engineering. Typically, real problems involve several hundreds of variables, and are subject to as many constraints. Several methods have been developed trying to reduce the theoretical time complexity. Nevertheless, when problems exceed reasonable sizes they end up being very computationally intensive. Heterogeneous systems composed by coupling commodity CPUs and GPUs are becoming relatively cheap, highly performing systems. Recent developments of GPGPU technologies give even more powerful control over them. In this paper, we show how we use a revised simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems originally described by Dantzig for both our CPU and GPU implementations. Previously, this approach has showed not to scale beyond around 200 variables. However, by taking advantage of modern libraries such as ATLAS for matrix-matrix multiplication, and the NVIDIA CUDA programming library on recent GPUs, we show that we can scale to problem sizes up to at least 2000 variables in our experiments for both architectures. On the GPU, we also achieve an appreciable precision on large problems with thousands of variables and constraints while achieving between 2X and 2.5X speed-ups over the serial ATLAS-based CPU version. With further tuning of both the algorithm and its implementations, even better results should be achievable for both the CPU and GPU versions.},

abstract = {The term "functional connectivity" is used to denote correlations in activation among spatially-distinct brain regions, either in a resting state or when processing external stimuli. Functional connectivity has been extensively evaluated with several functional neuroimaging methods, particularly PET and fMRI. Yet these relationships have been quantified using very different measures and the extent to which they index the same constructs is unclear. We have implemented a variety of these functional connectivity measures in a new freely available MATLAB toolbox. These measures are categorized into two groups: whole time-series and trial-based approaches. We evaluate these measures via simulations with different patterns of functional connectivity and provide recommendations for their use. We also apply these measures to a previously published fMRI data set (Siegle, G.J., Thompson, W., Carter, C.S., Steinhauer, S.R., Thase, M.E., 2007. Increased amygdala and decreased dorsolateral prefrontal BOLD responses in unipolar depression: related and independent features. Biol. Psychiatry 610 (2), 198-209) in which activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was evaluated in 32 control subjects during a digit sorting task. Though all implemented measures demonstrate functional connectivity between dACC and DLPFC activity during event-related tasks, different participants appeared to display qualitatively different relationships. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Interpreting brain diffusion MRI measurements in terms of neuronal structure at a micrometer level is an exciting unresolved problem. Here we consider diffusion transverse to a bundle of fibers, and show theoretically, as well as using Monte Carlo simulations and measurements in a phantom made of parallel fibers mimicking axons, that the time dependent diffusion coefficient approaches its macroscopic limit slowly, in a (ln t)/. t fashion. The logarithmic singularity arises due to short range disorder in the fiber packing. We identify short range disorder in axonal fibers based on histological data from the splenium, and argue that the time dependent contribution to the overall diffusion coefficient from the extra-axonal water dominates that of the intra-axonal water. This dominance may explain the bias in measuring axon diameters in clinical settings. The short range disorder is also reflected in the asymptotically linear frequency dependence of the diffusion coefficient measured with oscillating gradients, in agreement with recent experiments. Our results relate the measured diffusion to the mesoscopic structure of neuronal tissue, uncovering the sensitivity of diffusion metrics to axonal arrangement within a fiber tract, and providing an alternative interpretation of axonal diameter mapping techniques.},

abstract = {The MGH-USC CONNECTOM MRI scanner housed at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is a major hardware innovation of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The 3T CONNECTOM scanner is capable of producing a magnetic field gradient of up to 300. mT/m strength for in vivo human brain imaging, which greatly shortens the time spent on diffusion encoding, and decreases the signal loss due to T2 decay. To demonstrate the capability of the novel gradient system, data of healthy adult participants were acquired for this MGH-USC Adult Diffusion Dataset (N= 35), minimally preprocessed, and shared through the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Image Data Archive (LONI IDA) and the WU-Minn Connectome Database (ConnectomeDB). Another purpose of sharing the data is to facilitate methodological studies of diffusion MRI (dMRI) analyses utilizing high diffusion contrast, which perhaps is not easily feasible with standard MR gradient system. In addition, acquisition of the MGH-Harvard-USC Lifespan Dataset is currently underway to include 120 healthy participants ranging from 8 to 90 years old, which will also be shared through LONI IDA and ConnectomeDB. Here we describe the efforts of the MGH-USC HCP consortium in acquiring and sharing the ultra-high b-value diffusion MRI data and provide a report on data preprocessing and access. We conclude with a demonstration of the example data, along with results of standard diffusion analyses, including q-ball Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) reconstruction and tractography.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of the recently introduced Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT) framework for imaging prostate cancer with diffusionweighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) within a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: The VERDICT framework is a noninvasive microstructure imaging technique that combines an in-depth diffusionMRI acquisition with amathematicalmodel to estimate andmapmicrostructural tissue parameters such as cell size and density and vascular perfusion. In total, 8 patients underwent 3-TMRI using 9 different b values (100-3000 s/mm2). All patients were imaged before undergoing biopsy. Experiments with VERDICT analyzed DW-MRI data from patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer in areas of cancerous and benign peripheral zone tissue. For comparison,we also fitted commonly used diffusion models such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and the kurtosis model.We also investigated correlations of ADC and kurtosis with VERDICT parameters to gain some biophysical insight into the various parameter values. Results: Eight patients had prostate cancer in the peripheral zone, with Gleason score 3 + 3 (n = 1), 3 + 4 (n = 6), and 4 + 3 (n = 1). TheVERDICTmodel identified a significant increase in the intracellular and vascular volume fraction estimates in cancerous compared with benign peripheral zone, aswell as a significant decrease in the volume of the extracellular-extravascular space (EES) (P = 0.05). This is in agreement with manual segmentation of the biopsies for prostate tissue component analysis, which found proliferation of epithelium, loss of surrounding stroma, and an increase in vasculature. The standard ADC and kurtosis parameters were also significantly different (P = 0.05) between tissue types. There was no significant difference in any of the IVIM parameters (P = 0.11 to 0.29). The VERDICT parametric maps from voxel-by-voxel fitting clearly differentiated cancer from benign regions. Kurtosis and ADC parameters correlated most strongly with VERDICT's intracellular volume fraction but also moderately with the EES and vascular fractions. Conclusions: The VERDICT model distinguished tumor from benign areas, while revealing differences in microstructure descriptors such as cellular, vascular, and EES fractions. The parameters of ADC and kurtosis models also discriminated between cancer and benign regions. However, VERDICT provides more specific information that disentangles the various microstructural features underlying the changes in ADC and kurtosis. These results highlight the clinical potential of the VERDICT framework and motivate the construction of a shorter, clinically viable imaging protocol to enable larger trials leading to widespread translation of the method.},

Yet, identifying features such as axonal orientation dispersion, density, diameter, etc., in complex white matter fiber configurations (e.g. crossings) has proved challenging. Besides optimized data acquisition and advanced biophysical models, computational procedures to fit such models to the data are critical. However, these procedures have been largely overlooked by the dMRI microstructure community and new, more versatile, approaches are needed to solve complex biophysical model fitting problems. Existing methods are limited to models assuming single fiber orientation, relevant to limited brain areas like the corpus callosum, or multiple orientations but without the ability to extract detailed microstructural features. Here, we introduce a new and versatile optimization technique (MIX), which enables microstructure imaging of crossing white matter fibers. We provide a MATLAB implementation of MIX, and demonstrate its applicability to general microstructure models in fiber crossings using synthetic as well as ex-vivo and in-vivo brain data.},

abstract = {This paper presents MicroTrack, an algorithm that combines global tractography and direct microstructure estimation using diffusion-weighted imaging data. Previous work recovers connectivity via tractography independently from estimating microstructure features, such as axon diameter distribution and density. However, the two estimates have great potential to inform one another given the common assumption that microstructural features remain consistent along fibers. Here we provide a preliminary examination of this hypothesis. We adapt a global tractography algorithm to associate axon diameter with each putative pathway and optimize both the set of pathways and their microstructural parameters to find the best fit of this holistic white-matter model to the MRI data. We demonstrate in simulation that, with a multi-shell HARDI acquisition, this approach not only improves estimates of microstructural parameters over voxel-by-voxel estimation, but provides a solution to long standing problems in tractography. In particular, a simple experiment demonstrates the resolution of the well known ambiguity between crossing and kissing fibers. The results strongly motivate further development of this kind of algorithm for brain connectivity mapping.},

abstract = {Tissue classification plays a crucial role in the investigation of normal neural development, brain-behavior relationships, and the disease mechanisms of many psychiatric and neurological illnesses. Ensuring the accuracy of tissue classification is important for quality research and, in particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct various errors inherent to all currently available segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data, an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software package in any data organization structure. Example configurations for three large, open-source datasets are presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics, regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and complexity of study.},

abstract = {In this article, we highlight an issue that arises when using multiple b-values in a model-based analysis of diffusion MR data for tractography. The non-monoexponential decay, commonly observed in experimental data, is shown to induce overfitting in the distribution of fiber orientations when not considered in the model. Extra fiber orientations perpendicular to the main orientation arise to compensate for the slower apparent signal decay at higher b-values. We propose a simple extension to the ball and stick model based on a continuous gamma distribution of diffusivities, which significantly improves the fitting and reduces the overfitting. Using in vivo experimental data, we show that this model outperforms a simpler, noise floor model, especially at the interfaces between brain tissues, suggesting that partial volume effects are a major cause of the observed non-monoexponential decay. This model may be helpful for future data acquisition strategies that may attempt to combine multiple shells to improve estimates of fiber orientations in white matter and near the cortex.},

We propose a simplified model of neural cytoarchitecture intended to capture the essential features important for water diffusion as measured by NMR. Two components contribute to the NMR signal in this model: (i) the dendrites and axons, which are modeled as long cylinders with two diffusion coefficients, parallel (DL) and perpendicular (DT) to the cylindrical axis, and (ii) an isotropic monoexponential diffusion component describing water diffusion within and across all other structures, i.e., in extracellular space and glia cells. The model parameters are estimated from 153 diffusion-weighted images acquired from a formalin-fixed baboon brain. A close correspondence between the data and the signal model is found, with the model parameters consistent with literature values. The model provides an estimate of dendrite density from noninvasive MR diffusion measurements, a parameter likely to be of value for understanding normal as well as abnormal brain development and function. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a method of producing a correlated sample to estimate characteristics of a target distribution. A fundamental question is how long should the simulation be run? One method to address this issue is to run the simulation until the width of a confidence interval for the quantity of interest is below a user-specified value. The use of this fixed-width methods requires an estimate of the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE). This dissertation begins by discussing why MCSEs are important, how they can be easily calculated in MCMC and how they can be used to decide when to stop the simulation. The use of MCSEs is then compared to a popular alternative in the context of multiple examples. This dissertation continues by discussing the relevant Markov chain theory with particular attention paid to the conditions and definitions needed to establish a Markov chain central limit theorem. Estimating MCSEs requires estimating the associated asymptotic variance. I introduce several techniques for estimating MCSEs: batch means, overlapping batch means, regeneration, subsampling and spectral variance estimation. Asymptotic properties useful in MCMC settings are established for these variance estimators. Specifically, I established conditions under which the estimator for the asymptotic variance in a Markov chain central limit theorem is strongly consistent. Strong consistency ensures that confidence intervals formed will be asymptotically valid. In addition, I established conditions to ensure mean-square consistency for the estimators using batch means and overlapping batch means. Mean-square consistency is useful in choosing an optimal batch size for MCMC practitioners.Several approaches have been introduced dealing with the special case of estimating ergodic averages and their corresponding standard errors. Surprisingly, very little attention has been given to characteristics of the target distribution that cannot be represented as ergodic averages. To this end, I proposed use of subsampling methods as a means for estimating the qth quantile of the posterior distribution. Finally, the finite sample properties of subsampling are examined.},

abstract = {With diffusion tensor imaging, the diffusion of water molecules through brain structures is quantified by parameters, which are estimated assuming monoexponential diffusion-weighted signal attenuation. The estimated diffusion parameters, however, depend on the diffusion weighting strength, the b-value, which hampers the interpretation and comparison of various diffusion tensor imaging studies. In this study, a likelihood ratio test is used to show that the diffusion kurtosis imaging model provides a more accurate parameterization of both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion component compared with diffusion tensor imaging. As a result, the diffusion kurtosis imaging model provides a b-value-independent estimation of the widely used diffusion tensor parameters as demonstrated with diffusion-weighted rat data, which was acquired with eight different b-values, uniformly distributed in a range of [0,2800 sec/mm(2)]. In addition, the diffusion parameter values are significantly increased in comparison to the values estimated with the diffusion tensor imaging model in all major rat brain structures. As incorrectly assuming additive Gaussian noise on the diffusion-weighted data will result in an overestimated degree of non-Gaussian diffusion and a b-value-dependent underestimation of diffusivity measures, a Rician noise model was used in this study.},

abstract = {Learning a novel motor skill is associated with well characterized structural and functional plasticity in the rodent motor cortex. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies of visuomotor learning in humans have suggested that structural plasticity can occur in white matter (WM), but the biological basis for such changes is unclear. We assessed the influence of motor skill learning on WM structure within sensorimotor cortex using both diffusion MRI fractional anisotropy (FA) and quantitative immunohistochemistry. Seventy-two adult (male) rats were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (skilled reaching, unskilled reaching, and caged control). After 11 d of training, postmortem diffusion MRI revealed significantly higher FA in the skilled reaching group compared with the control groups, specifically in the WM subjacent to the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the trained limb. In addition, within the skilled reaching group, FA across widespread regions of WM in the contralateral hemisphere correlated significantly with learning rate. Immunohistological analysis conducted on a subset of 24 animals (eight per group) revealed significantly increased myelin staining in the WM underlying motor cortex in the hemisphere contralateral (but not ipsilateral) to the trained limb for the skilled learning group versus the control groups. Within the trained hemisphere (but not the untrained hemisphere), myelin staining density correlated significantly with learning rate. Our results suggest that learning a novel motor skill induces structural change in task-relevant WM pathways and that these changes may in part reflect learning-related increases in myelination.},

abstract = {After 140 years from the discovery of Golgi's black reaction, the study of connectivity of the cerebellum remains a fascinating yet challenging task. Current histological techniques provide powerful methods for unravelling local axonal architecture, but the relatively low volume of data that can be acquired in a reasonable amount of time limits their application to small samples. State-of-the-art in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, such as diffusion tractography techniques, can reveal trajectories of the major white matter pathways, but their correspondence with underlying anatomy is yet to be established. Hence, a significant gap exists between these two approaches as neither of them can adequately describe the three-dimensional complexity of fibre architecture at the level of the mesoscale (from a few millimetres to micrometres). In this study, we report the application of MR diffusion histology and micro-tractography methods to reveal the combined cytoarchitectural organisation and connectivity of the human cerebellum at a resolution of 100-$\mu$m (2 nl/voxel volume). Results show that the diffusion characteristics for each layer of the cerebellar cortex correctly reflect the known cellular composition and its architectural pattern. Micro-tractography also reveals details of the axonal connectivity of individual cerebellar folia and the intra-cortical organisation of the different cerebellar layers. The direct correspondence between MR diffusion histology and micro-tractography with immunohistochemistry indicates that these approaches have the potential to complement traditional histology techniques by providing a non-destructive, quantitative and three-dimensional description of the microstructural organisation of the healthy and pathological tissue.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.},

A unique new MRI modality, called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the three-dimensional study of the large white matter (WM) fiber bundles at macroscopic resolution (millimeter scale). MRI Atlas of Human White Matter provides a three-dimensional and two-dimensional in vivo atlas of various white matter tracts in the human brain. The images are based on diffusion tensor imaging and various tracts are reconstructed three-dimensionally from the data. Following an introduction and description of the methodology (Chapters 1 and 2), the 3D anatomy of individual tracts is delineated in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 consists of a series of color-coded orientation maps to delineate white matter anatomy in a slice-by-slice manner, in which the structures are extensively annotated. This richly illustrated Atlas is a valuable resource for students studying white matter anatomy and researchers working in brain research and radiology. This book also provides the structural assignment, which will assist neuroradiologists when interpreting diffusion tensor images in routine clinical studies. * Contains information demonstrating the clear separation of grey matter and white matter structures in the living human brain * 3D white matter tract reconstruction, with extensive 2D panels in all three viewing angles * Comprehensive annotations of white matter structures},

abstract = {Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) has become one of the most widely used methods to extract white matter (WM) fibre orientation information from diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain apparent fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent, there is a growing need for CSD to fully support such data. Furthermore, CSD can only provide high quality fODF estimates in voxels containing WM only. In voxels containing other tissue types such as grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the WM response function may no longer be appropriate and spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy fODF estimates.The aim of this study is to incorporate support for multi-shell data into the CSD approach as well as to exploit the unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to estimate a multi-tissue ODF. The resulting approach is dubbed multi-shell, multi-tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD) and is compared to the state-of-the-art single-shell, single-tissue CSD (SSST-CSD) approach. Using both simulations and real data, we show that MSMT-CSD can produce reliable WM/GM/CSF volume fraction maps, directly from the DW data, whereas SSST-CSD has a tendency to overestimate the WM volume in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. In addition, compared to SSST-CSD, MSMT-CSD can substantially increase the precision of the fODF fibre orientations and reduce the presence of spurious fODF peaks in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. Both effects translate into more reliable AFD measures and tractography results with MSMT-CSD compared to SSST-CSD.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) produces a correlated sample for estimating expectations with respect to a target distribution. A fundamental question is when should sampling stop so that we have good estimates of the desired quantities? The key to answering this question lies in assessing the Monte Carlo error through a multivariate Markov chain central limit theorem (CLT). The multivariate nature of this Monte Carlo error largely has been ignored in the MCMC literature. We present a multivariate framework for terminating simulation in MCMC. We define a multivariate effective sample size, estimating which requires strongly consistent estimators of the covariance matrix in the Markov chain CLT; a property we show for the multivariate batch means estimator. We then provide a lower bound on the number of minimum effective samples required for a desired level of precision. This lower bound depends on the problem only in the dimension of the expectation being estimated, and not on the underlying stochastic process. This result is obtained by drawing a connection between terminating simulation via effective sample size and terminating simulation using a relative standard deviation fixed-volume sequential stopping rule; which we demonstrate is an asymptotically valid procedure. The finite sample properties of the proposed method are demonstrated in a variety of examples.},

abstract = {Due to its unique sensitivity to tissue microstructure, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found many applications in clinical and fundamental science. With few exceptions, a more precise correspondence between physiological or biophysical properties and the obtained diffusion parameters remain uncertain due to lack of specificity. In this work, we address this problem by comparing diffusion parameters of a recently introduced model for water diffusion in brain matter to light microscopy and quantitative electron microscopy. Specifically, we compare diffusion model predictions of neurite density in rats to optical myelin staining intensity and stereological estimation of neurite volume fraction using electron microscopy. We find that the diffusion model describes data better and that its parameters show stronger correlation with optical and electron microscopy, and thus reflect myelinated neurite density better than the more frequently used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cumulant expansion methods. Furthermore, the estimated neurite orientations capture dendritic architecture more faithfully than DTI diffusion ellipsoids. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In diffusion MRI (dMRI), microscopic diffusion anisotropy can be obscured by orientation dispersion. Separation of these properties is of high importance, since it could allow dMRI to non-invasively probe elongated structures such as neurites (axons and dendrites). However, conventional dMRI, based on single diffusion encoding (SDE), entangles microscopic anisotropy and orientation dispersion with intra-voxel variance in isotropic diffusivity. SDE-based methods for estimating microscopic anisotropy, such as the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) method, must thus rely on model assumptions to disentangle these features. An alternative approach is to directly quantify microscopic anisotropy by the use of variable shape of the b-tensor. Along those lines, we here present the ‘constrained diffusional variance decomposition' (CODIVIDE) method, which jointly analyzes data acquired with diffusion encoding applied in a single direction at a time (linear tensor encoding, LTE) and in all directions (spherical tensor encoding, STE). We then contrast the two approaches by comparing neurite density estimated using NODDI with microscopic anisotropy estimated using CODIVIDE. Data were acquired in healthy volunteers and in glioma patients. NODDI and CODIVIDE differed the most in gray matter and in gliomas, where NODDI detected a neurite fraction higher than expected from the level of microscopic diffusion anisotropy found with CODIVIDE. The discrepancies could be explained by the NODDI tortuosity assumption, which enforces a connection between the neurite density and the mean diffusivity of tissue. Our results suggest that this assumption is invalid, which leads to a NODDI neurite density that is inconsistent between LTE and STE data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the NODDI assumptions result in parameter bias that precludes the use of NODDI to map neurite density. With CODIVIDE, we found high levels of microscopic anisotropy in white matter, intermediate levels in structures such as the thalamus and the putamen, and low levels in the cortex and in gliomas. We conclude that accurate mapping of microscopic anisotropy requires data acquired with variable shape of the b-tensor.},

abstract = {To characterize anisotropic water diffusion in brain white matter, a theoretical framework is proposed that combines hindered and restricted models of water diffusion (CHARMED) and an experimental methodology that embodies features of diffusion tensor and q-space MRI. This model contains a hindered extra-axonal compartment, whose diffusion properties are characterized by an effective diffusion tensor, and an intra-axonal compartment, whose diffusion properties are characterized by a restricted model of diffusion within cylinders. The hindered model primarily explains the Gaussian signal attenuation observed at low b values; the restricted non-Gaussian model does so at high b. Both high and low b data obtained along different directions are required to estimate various microstructural parameters of the composite model, such as the nerve fiber orientation(s), the T2-weighted extra- and intra-axonal volume fractions, and principal diffusivities. The proposed model provides a description of restricted diffusion in 3D given by a 3D probability distribution (average propagator), which is obtained by 3D Fourier transformation of the estimated signal attenuation profile. The new model is tested using synthetic phantoms and validated on excised spinal cord tissue. This framework shows promise in determining the orientations of two or more fiber compartments more precisely and accurately than with diffusion tensor imaging.},

abstract = {The NODDI-DTI signal model is a modification of the NODDI signal model that formally allows interpretation of standard single-shell DTI data in terms of biophysical parameters in healthy human white matter (WM). The NODDI-DTI signal model contains no CSF compartment, restricting application to voxels without CSF partial-volume contamination. This modification allowed derivation of analytical relations between parameters representing axon density and dispersion, and DTI invariants (MD and FA) from the NODDI-DTI signal model. These relations formally allow extraction of biophysical parameters from DTI data. NODDI-DTI parameters were estimated by applying the proposed analytical relations to DTI parameters estimated from the first shell of data, and compared to parameters estimated by fitting the NODDI-DTI model to both shells of data (reference dataset) in the WM of fourteen in vivo diffusion datasets recorded with two different protocols, and in simulated data. The first two datasets were also fit to the NODDI-DTI model using only the first shell (as for DTI) of data. NODDI-DTI parameters estimated from DTI, and NODDI-DTI parameters estimated by fitting the model to the first shell of data gave similar errors compared to two-shell NODDI-DTI estimates. The simulations showed the NODDI-DTI method to be more noise-robust than the two-shell fitting procedure. The NODDI-DTI method gave unphysical parameter estimates in a small percentage of voxels, reflecting voxelwise DTI estimation error or NODDI-DTI model invalidity. In the course of evaluating the NODDI-DTI model, it was found that diffusional kurtosis strongly biased DTI-based MD values, and so, making assumptions based on healthy WM, a novel heuristic correction requiring only DTI data was derived and used to mitigate this bias. Since validations were only performed on healthy WM, application to grey matter or pathological WM would require further validation. Our results demonstrate NODDI-DTI to be a promising model and technique to interpret restricted datasets acquired for DTI analysis in healthy white matter with greater biophysical specificity, though its limitations must be borne in mind.},

abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30. min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition time to just 10. min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such as neonatal and dementia imaging. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Synopsis The aim of this study is to extend the AMICO framework to the VERDICT model-based diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) technique and to evaluate its performance to prostate cancer imaging. DW-MRI was acquired for 4 subjects and the VERDICT model was fitted to the data using both fitting procedures. In both cases similar differences in parameter values between tumour and normal tissue were found. The AMICO formulation reduces the computation time for VERDICT and produces parameter maps that are more homogeneous than those obtained with the original fitting. The AMICO formulation reflects the microstructural differences in a clinically practical time. Abstract Purpose The aim of this study is to extend the AMICO 1 (Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimisation) framework to the VERDICT 2,3 (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) model-based diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) technique and to evaluate its performance in the clinical application for prostate cancer imaging. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in all economically developed countries 4. A non-invasive method of diagnosis and grading would revolutionise clinical practice. VERDICT, a model-based technique, for characterising microstructural tissue parameters has shown promise in preclinical studies 2 and in a pilot clinical setting 3 for discriminating normal and malignant prostate tissue. However, VERDICT uses a computationally expensive non-linear fitting procedure to estimate model parameters from the data, which limits its use in large cohort studies and real-time clinical applications. Recently, ultrafast fitting algorithms, such as the AMICO framework, have been developed to address the computational cost of model-based microstructure-imaging techniques. Through linearization and convex optimisation, AMICO reduces dramatically the computational cost of microstructure imaging techniques in the brain and locates the global minimum parameter values more reliably.},

abstract = {There is a need for biomarkers that are useful for noninvasive imaging of tumor pathophysiology and drug efficacy. Through its use of endogenous water, diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) can be used to probe local tissue architecture and structure. However, most DW-MRI studies of cancer tissues have relied on simplistic mathematical models, such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) models, which produce equivocal results on the relation of the model parameter estimate with the underlying tissue microstructure. Here, we present a novel technique called VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumors) to quantify and map histologic features of tumors in vivo. VERDICT couples DW-MRI to a mathematical model of tumor tissue to access features such as cell size, vascular volume fraction, intra- and extracellular volume fractions, and pseudo-diffusivity associated with blood flow. To illustrate VERDICT, we used two tumor xenograft models of colorectal cancer with different cellular and vascular phenotypes. Our experiments visualized known differences in the tissue microstructure of each model and the significant decrease in cell volume resulting from administration of the cytotoxic drug gemcitabine, reflecting the apoptotic volume decrease. In contrast, the standard ADC and IVIM models failed to detect either of these differences. Our results illustrate the superior features of VERDICT for cancer imaging, establishing it as a noninvasive method to monitor and stratify treatment responses. Cancer Res; 74(7); 1902-12.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Along with cortical abnormalities, white matter microstructural changes such as axonal loss and myelin breakdown are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recently, a white matter model was introduced that relates non-Gaussian diffusional kurtosis imaging metrics to characteristics of white matter tract integrity, including the axonal water fraction, the intra-axonal diffusivity, and the extra-axonal axial and radial diffusivities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study reports these white matter tract integrity metrics in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 12), Alzheimer disease (n = 14), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 15) in an effort to investigate their sensitivity, diagnostic accuracy, and associations with white matter changes through the course of Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: With tract-based spatial statistics and region-of-interest analyses, increased diffusivity in the extra-axonal space (extra-axonal axial and radial diffusivities) in several white matter tracts sensitively and accurately discriminated healthy controls from those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82-0.95), while widespread decreased axonal water fraction discriminated amnestic mild cognitive impairment from Alzheimer disease (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.84). Additionally, these white matter tract integrity metrics in the body of the corpus callosum were strongly correlated with processing speed in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (r = |0.80-0.82|, P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for the course and spatial progression of white matter degeneration in Alzheimer disease, suggest the mechanisms by which these changes occur, and demonstrate the viability of these white matter tract integrity metrics as potential neuroimaging biomarkers of the earliest stages of Alzheimer disease and disease progression.},

abstract = {Slowly convergent series and sequences as well as divergent series occur quite frequently in the mathematical treatment of scientific problems. In this report, a large number of mainly nonlinear sequence transformations for the acceleration of convergence and the summation of divergent series are discussed. Some of the sequence transformations of this report as for instance Wynn's z algorithm or Levin's sequence transformation are well established in the literature on convergence acceleration, but the majority of them is new. Efficient algorithms for the evaluation of these transformations are derived. The theoretical properties of the sequence transforma- tions in convergence acceleration and summation processes are analyzed. Finally, the performance of the sequence transformations of this report are tested by applying them to certain slowly convergent and divergent series, which are hopefully realistic models for a large part of the slowly convergent or divergent series that can occur in scientific problems and in applied mathematics.},

abstract = {Automatic differentiation is a semantic transformation that applies the rules of differential calculus to source code. It thus transforms a computer program that computes a mathematical function into a program that computes the function and its derivatives. Derivatives play an important role in a wide variety of scientific computing applications, including optimization, solution of nonlinear equations, sensitivity analysis, and nonlinear inverse problems. We describe a simple component architecture for developing tools for automatic differentiation and other mathematically oriented semantic transformations of scientific software. This architecture consists of a compiler-based, language-specific front-end for source transformation, loosely coupled with one or more language-independent ``plug-in{\{}''{\}} transformation modules. The coupling mechanism between the front-end and transformation modules is provided by the XML Abstract Interface Form (XAIF). XAIF provides an abstract, language-independent representation of language constructs common in imperative languages, such as C and Fortran. We describe the use of this architecture in constructing tools for automatic differentiation of Fortran 77 and ANSI C, and we discuss how access to compiler optimization techniques can enable more efficient derivative augmentation.},

abstract = {1. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a simulation technique that has revolutionised the analysis of ecological data, allowing the fitting of complex models in a Bayesian framework. Since 2001, there have been nearly 200 papers using MCMC in publications of the Ecological Society of America and the British Ecological Society, including more than 75 in the journal Ecology and 35 in the Journal of Applied Ecology. 2. We have noted that many authors routinely 'thin' their simulations, discarding all but every kth sampled value; of the studies we surveyed with details on MCMC implementation, 40{\%} reported thinning. 3. Thinning is often unnecessary and always inefficient, reducing the precision with which features of the Markov chain are summarised. The inefficiency of thinning MCMC output has been known since the early 1990' s, long before MCMC appeared in ecological publications. 4. We discuss the background and prevalence of thinning, illustrate its consequences, discuss circumstances when it might be regarded as a reasonable option and recommend against routine thinning of chains unless necessitated by computer memory limitations.},

abstract = {White matter microstructural changes during the first three years of healthy brain development are characterized using two different models developed for limited clinical diffusion data: White Matter Tract Integrity (WMTI) metrics from Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI). Both models reveal a non-linear increase in intra-axonal water fraction and in tortuosity of the extra-axonal space as a function of age, in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The changes are consistent with expected behavior related to myelination and asynchrony of fiber development. The intra- and extracellular axial diffusivities as estimated with WMTI do not change appreciably in normal brain development. The quantitative differences in parameter estimates between models are examined and explained in the light of each model's assumptions and consequent biases, as highlighted in simulations. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of a model with fewer assumptions.},

@article{Raftery1992a,
abstract = {We congratulate Andrew Gelman, Don Rubin and Charlie Geyer on a pair of articles that together summarize many of the important issues in the implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. They both make important and valid points. We do not agree fully with the recommendations in either article, however. We recommend that inference ultimately be based on a single long run, but that this be monitored using carefully chosen diagnostics, and that starting values and the exact form of the algorithm be chosen on the basis of experimentation. More complex and expensive methods such as those of Gelman and Rubin seem rarely to be necessary in standard statistical models. Theory suggests that Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference be based on a single long run. Gel- man and Rubin, by contrast, argue that the uncer- tainty associated with the choice of starting value should be taken into account by using several runs with different starting values. However; this uncertainty seems to be small in most statistical problems, given a realistically large number of MCMC iterations. Nevertheless, a bad starting value can lead to slow convergence. This can be diagnosed from one run and rectified by changing the starting value. Diagnostics should monitor all the key features of the model, such as hyperparameters in hierarchical models, as well as a selection of less essential features such as random effects. If only the quantities of interest are monitored, lack of convergence can be missed. By the same token, Geyer's time-series variance esti- mation methods can give misleading results in the absence of diagnostics. There seems to be no reason to abandon standard spectral analysis methods in favor of Geyer's initial sequence estimators. Many Bayesian statistical problems boil down to the calculation of quantiles of marginal posterior distributions of quanti- ties of interest, and then there are simpler methods that do not have the problem of sensitivity to a spectral window width. Methods based on quantiles also yield simple and effective diagnostics.},

@article{Alexander2010,
abstract = {This paper proposes and tests a technique for imaging orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density in white matter using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Such indices potentially provide more specific markers of white matter microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging. Orientational invariance allows for combination with tractography and presents new opportunities for mapping brain connectivity and quantifying disease processes. The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition. We test the method in simulation, on fixed monkey brains using a preclinical scanner and on live human brains using a clinical 3. T scanner. The human data take about one hour to acquire. The simulation experiments show that both monkey and human protocols distinguish distributions of axon diameters that occur naturally in white matter. We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent, but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons. Maps of axon diameter and density indices from the monkey and human data in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract reflect known trends from histology. The results show orientationally invariant sensitivity to natural axon diameter distributions for the first time with both specialist and clinical hardware. This demonstration motivates further refinement, validation, and evaluation of the precise nature of the indices and the influence of potential confounds. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper presents a parameter sensitivity study of the Nelder-Mead Simplex Method for unconstrained optimization. Nelder-Mead Simplex Method is very easy to implement in practice, because it does not require gradient computation; however, it is very sensitive to the choice of initial points selected. Fan-Zahara conducted a sensitivity study using a select set of test cases and suggested the best values for the parameters based on the highest percentage rate of successful minimization. Begambre-Laier used a strategy to control the Particle Swarm Optimization parameters based on the Nelder Mead Simplex Method in identifying structural damage. The main purpose of the paper is to extend their parameter sensitivity study to better understand the parameter's behavior. The comprehensive parameter sensitivity study was conducted on seven test functions: B2, Beale, Booth, Wood, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock and Sphere Functions to search for common patterns and relationships each parameter has in producing the optimum solution. The results show important relations of the Nelder-Mead Simplex parameters: reflection, expansion, contraction, and Simplex size and how they impact the optimum solutions. This study is crucial, because better understanding of the parameters behavior can motivate current and future research using Nelder-Mead Simplex in creating an intelligent algorithm, which can be more effective, efficient, and save computational time. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A Multivariate Normal Distribution is proposed as a parametric statistical model of diffusion tensor data when magnitude MR images contain no artifacts other than Johnson noise. We test this model using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of DT-MRI experiments. The non-parametric approach proposed here is an implementation of bootstrap methodology that we call the DT-MRI bootstrap. It is used to estimate an empirical probability distribution of experimental DT-MRI data, and to perform hypothesis tests on them. The DT-MRI bootstrap is also used to obtain various statistics of DT-MRI parameters within a single voxel, and within a region of interest (ROI); we also use the bootstrap to study the intrinsic variability of these parameters in the ROI, independent of background noise. We evaluate the DT-MRI bootstrap using MC simulations and apply it to DT-MRI data acquired on human brain in vivo, and on a phantom with uniform diffusion properties.

In this article we propose a new forward model that maps the microscopic geometry of nervous tissue onto the water diffusion process and further onto the measured MR signals. Our spherical deconvolution approach completely parameterizes the fiber orientation density by a finite mixture of Bingham distributions. In addition, we define the term anatomical connectivity, taking the underlying image modality into account. This neurophysiological metric may represent the proportion of the nerve fibers originating in the source area which intersect a given target region. The specified inverse problem is solved by Bayesian statistics. Posterior probability maps denote the probability that the connectivity value exceeds a chosen threshold, conditional upon the noisy observations. These maps allow us to draw inferences about the structural organization of the cerebral cortex. Moreover, we will demonstrate the proposed approach with diffusion-weighted data sets featuring high angular resolution. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) allows detecting molecular brain changes in vivo. However, the accuracy of PET is limited by partial volume effects (PVE) that affects quantitative analysis and visual interpretation of the images. Although PVE-correction methods have been shown to effectively increase the correspondence of the measured signal with the true regional tracer uptake, these procedures are still not commonly applied, neither in clinical nor in research settings. Here, we present an implementation of well validated PVE-correction procedures as a SPM toolbox, PETPVE12, for automated processing. We demonstrate its utility by a comprehensive analysis of the effects of PVE-correction on amyloid-sensitive AV45-PET data from 85 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 179 cognitively normal (CN) elderly. Effects of PVE-correction on global cortical standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) and the power of diagnostic group separation were assessed for the region-wise geometric transfer matrix method (PVEc-GTM), as well as for the 3-compartmental voxel-wise “M{\"{u}}ller-G{\"{a}}rtner” method (PVEc-MG). Both PVE-correction methods resulted in decreased global cortical SUVRs in the low to middle range of SUVR values, and in increased global cortical SUVRs at the high values. As a consequence, average SUVR of the CN group was reduced, whereas average SUVR of the AD group was increased by PVE-correction. These effects were also reflected in increased accuracies of group discrimination after PVEc-GTM (AUC=0.86) and PVEc-MG (AUC=0.89) compared to standard non-corrected SUVR (AUC=0.84). Voxel-wise analyses of PVEc-MG corrected data also demonstrated improved detection of regionally increased AV45 SUVR values in AD patients. These findings complement the growing evidence for a beneficial effect of PVE-correction in quantitative analysis of amyloid-sensitive PET data. The novel PETPVE12 toolbox significantly facilitates the application of PVE-correction, particularly within SPM-based processing pipelines. This is expected to foster the use of PVE-correction in brain PET for more widespread use. The toolbox is freely available at http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ext/{\#}PETPVE12.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive method that potentially gives insight into the brain's white matter structure regarding the pathway of connections and properties of the axons.Here, we propose a novel global tractography method named Plausibility Tracking that provides the most plausible pathway, modeled as a smooth spline curve, between two locations in the brain. Compared to other tractography methods, plausibility tracking combines the more complete connectivity pattern of probabilistic tractography with smooth tracks that are globally optimized using the fiber orientation density function and hence is relatively robust against local noise and error propagation. It has been tested on phantom and biological data and compared to other methods of tractography. Plausibility tracking provides reliable local directions all along the fiber pathways which makes it especially interesting for tract-based analysis in combination with direction dependent indices of diffusion MRI.In order to demonstrate this potential of plausibility tracking, we propose a framework for the assessment and comparison of diffusion derived tissue properties. This framework comprises atlas-guided parameterization of tract representation and advanced bundle-specific indices describing fiber density, fiber spread and white matter complexity. We explore the new method using real data and show that it allows for a more specific interpretation of the white matter's microstructure compared to rotationally invariant indices derived from the diffusion tensor. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

Recently, deviance information criteria (DIC) has been extensively employed in various study areas to evaluate the Bayesian models, thanks to its simplicity of calculation from the posterior simulation outputs. Unfortunately, it is known that DIC often selects overfitted models. In this paper, we develop a new criterion which can be calculated easily from posterior outputs under the model misspecification situation. The proposed criterion is developed as an estimator of the posterior mean of the expected likelihood and is robust to improper priors.

Using automatic relevance determination, we are able to perform online selection of the number of fibre orientations supported by the data at each voxel, simplifying the problem of tracking in a multi-orientation field. We then apply the identical probabilistic algorithm to tractography in the multi- and single-fibre cases in a number of example systems which have previously been tracked successfully or unsuccessfully with single-fibre tractography. We show that multi-fibre tractography offers significant advantages in sensitivity when tracking non-dominant fibre populations, but does not dramatically change tractography results for the dominant pathways. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Observations on axes which lack information on the direction of propagation are referred to as axial data. Such data are often encountered in enviromental sciences, e.g. observations on propagations of cracks or on faults in mining walls. Even though such observations are recorded as angles, circular probability models are inappropriate for such data since the constraint that observations lie only in [0, pi) needs to be enforced. Probability models for such axial data are argued here to have a general structure stemming from that of wrapping a circular distribution on a semi-circle. In particular, we consider the most popular circular model, the von Mises or circular normal distribution, and derive the corresponding axial normal distribution. Certain properties of this distribution are established. Maximum likelihood estimation of its parameters are shown to be surprisingly, in contrast to trigonometric moment estimation, numerically quite appealing. Finally we illustrate our results by several real life axial data sets.},

These are: 1) resting state functional MR imaging (rfMRI) which uses correlations in the temporal fluctuations in an fMRI time series to deduce '. functional connectivity'; 2) diffusion imaging (dMRI), which provides the input for tractography algorithms used for the reconstruction of the complex axonal fiber architecture; and 3) task based fMRI (tfMRI), which is employed to identify functional parcellation in the human brain in order to assist analyses of data obtained with the first two methods. We describe technical improvements and optimization of these methods as well as instrumental choices that impact speed of acquisition of fMRI and dMRI images at 3. T, leading to whole brain coverage with 2. mm isotropic resolution in 0.7. s for fMRI, and 1.25. mm isotropic resolution dMRI data for tractography analysis with three-fold reduction in total dMRI data acquisition time. Ongoing technical developments and optimization for acquisition of similar data at 7. T magnetic field are also presented, targeting higher spatial resolution, enhanced specificity of functional imaging signals, mitigation of the inhomogeneous radio frequency (RF) fields, and reduced power deposition.

abstract = {High-performance computing has recently seen a surge of interest in heterogeneous systems, with an emphasis on modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These devices offer tremendous potential for performance and efficiency in important large-scale applications of computational science. However, exploiting this potential can be challenging, as one must adapt to the specialized and rapidly evolving computing environment currently exhibited by GPUs. One way of addressing this challenge is to embrace better techniques and develop tools tailored to their needs. This article presents one simple technique, GPU run-time code generation (RTCG), along with PyCUDA and PyOpenCL, two open-source toolkits that supports this technique. In introducing PyCUDA and PyOpenCL, this article proposes the combination of a dynamic, high-level scripting language with the massive performance of a GPU as a compelling two-tiered computing platform, potentially offering significant performance and productivity advantages over conventional single-tier, static systems. The concept of RTCG is simple and easily implemented using existing, robust infrastructure. Nonetheless it is powerful enough to support (and encourage) the creation of custom application-specific tools by its users. The premise of the paper is illustrated by a wide range of examples where the technique has been applied with considerable success. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum algorithms.},

abstract = {There is currently no calibration available for the whole human mtDNA genome, incorporating both coding and control regions. Furthermore, as several authors have pointed out recently, linear molecular clocks that incorporate selectable characters are in any case problematic. We here confirm a modest effect of purifying selection on the mtDNA coding region and propose an improved molecular clock for dating human mtDNA, based on a worldwide phylogeny of {\textgreater} 2000 complete mtDNA genomes and calibrating against recent evidence for the divergence time of humans and chimpanzees. We focus on a time-dependent mutation rate based on the entire mtDNA genome and supported by a neutral clock based on synonymous mutations alone. We show that the corrected rate is further corroborated by archaeological dating for the settlement of the Canary Islands and Remote Oceania and also, given certain phylogeographic assumptions, by the timing of the first modern human settlement of Europe and resettlement after the Last Glacial Maximum. The corrected rate yields an age of modern human expansion in the Americas at similar to 15 kya that-unlike the uncorrected clock matches the archaeological evidence, but continues to indicate an out-of-Africa dispersal at around 55-70 kya, 5-20 ky before any clear archaeological record, suggesting the need for archaeological research efforts focusing on this time window. We also present improved rates for the mtDNA control region, and the first comprehensive estimates of positional mutation rates for human mtDNA, which are essential for defining mutation models in phylogenetic analyses.},

@article{Harms2018_bioarxiv,
abstract = {In diffusion MRI analysis, advances in biophysical multi-compartment modeling have gained popularity over the conventional Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), because they possess greater specificity in relating the dMRI signal to underlying cellular microstructure. Biophysical multi-compartment models require parameter estimation, typically performed using either Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling. Whereas MLE provides only a point estimate of the fitted model parameters, MCMC recovers the entire posterior distribution of the model parameters given the data, providing additional information such as parameter uncertainty and correlations. MCMC sampling is currently not routinely applied in dMRI microstructure modeling because it requires adjustments and tuning specific to each model, particularly in the choice of proposal distributions, burn-in length, thinning and the number of samples to store. In addition, sampling often takes at least an order of magnitude more time than non-linear optimization. Here we investigate the performance of MCMC algorithm variations over multiple popular diffusion microstructure models to see whether a single well performing variation could be applied efficiently and robustly to many models. Using an efficient GPU-based implementation, we show that run times can be removed as a prohibitive constraint for sampling of diffusion multi-compartment models. Using this implementation, we investigated the effectiveness of different adaptive MCMC algorithms, burn-in, initialization and thinning. Finally we apply the theory of Effective Sample Size to diffusion multi-compartment models as a way of determining a relatively general target for the number of samples needed to characterize parameter distributions for different models and datasets. We conclude that robust and fast sampling is achieved in most diffusion microstructure models with the Adaptive Metropolis-Within-Gibbs (AMWG) algorithm initialized with an MLE point estimate, in which case 100 to 200 samples are sufficient as a burn-in and thinning is mostly unnecessary. As a relatively general target for the number of samples, we recommend a multivariate Effective Sample Size of 2200.},

@article{Tournier2007,
abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial specificity governs the choice of spatial resolution in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is no exception. Images of lower resolution have higher signal to noise ratio, but also more partial volume artifacts. We present a data-fusion approach for tackling this trade-off by combining DW MRI data acquired both at high and low spatial resolution. We combine all data into a single Bayesian model to estimate the underlying fiber patterns and diffusion parameters. The proposed model, therefore, combines the benefits of each acquisition. We show that fiber crossings at the highest spatial resolution can be inferred more robustly and accurately using such a model compared to a simpler model that operates only on high-resolution data, when both approaches are matched for acquisition time.},

abstract = {For the past 25 years, the field of neuroimaging has witnessed the development of several software packages for processing multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to study the brain. These software packages are now routinely used by researchers and clinicians, and have contributed to important breakthroughs for the understanding of brain anatomy and function. However, no software package exists to process mpMRI data of the spinal cord. Despite the numerous clinical needs for such advanced mpMRI protocols (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, etc.), researchers have been developing specific tools that, while necessary, do not provide an integrative framework that is compatible with most usages and that is capable of reaching the community at large. This hinders cross-validation and the possibility to perform multi-center studies. In this study we introduce the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), a comprehensive software dedicated to the processing of spinal cord MRI data. SCT builds on previously-validated methods and includes state-of-the-art MRI templates and atlases of the spinal cord, algorithms to segment and register new data to the templates, and motion correction methods for diffusion and functional time series. SCT is tailored towards standardization and automation of the processing pipeline, versatility, modularity, and it follows guidelines of software development and distribution. Preliminary applications of SCT cover a variety of studies, from cross-sectional area measures in large databases of patients, to the precise quantification of mpMRI metrics in specific spinal pathways. We anticipate that SCT will bring together the spinal cord neuroimaging community by establishing standard templates and analysis procedures.},

Although the DW-SSFP signal is well characterized for isotropic, Gaussian diffusion, it is unclear how the DW-SSFP signal propagates in inhomogeneous media such as brain tissue. This article presents a more general analytical expression for the DW-SSFP signal which accommodates Gaussian and non-Gaussian spin displacement probability density functions. This new framework for calculating the DW-SSFP signal is used to investigate signal behavior for a single fiber, crossing fibers, and reflective barriers. DW-SSFP measurements in the corpus callosum of a fixed brain are shown to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Further measurements in fixed brain tissue also demonstrate that 3D DW-SSFP out-performs 3D diffusion weighted spin echo in both SNR and CNR efficiency providing a compelling example of its potential to be used for high resolution diffusion tensor imaging.},

abstract = {Spherical deconvolution (SD) methods are widely used to estimate the intra-voxel white-matter fiber orientations from diffusion MRI data. However, while some of these methods assume a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for the underlying noise, its real distribution is known to be non-Gaussian and to depend on the methodology used to combine multichannel signals. Indeed, the two prevailing methods for multichannel signal combination lead to Rician and noncentral Chi noise distributions. Here we develop a Robust and Unbiased Model-BAsed Spherical Deconvolution (RUMBA-SD) technique, intended to deal with realistic MRI noise, based on a Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm adapted to Rician and noncentral Chi likelihood models. To quantify the benefits of using proper noise models, RUMBA-SD was compared with dRL-SD, a well-established method based on the RL algorithm for Gaussian noise. Another aim of the study was to quantify the impact of including a total variation (TV) spatial regularization term in the estimation framework. To do this, we developed TV spatially-regularized versions of both RUMBA-SD and dRL-SD algorithms. The evaluation was performed by comparing various quality metrics on 132 three-dimensional synthetic phantoms involving different inter-fiber angles and volume fractions, which were contaminated with noise mimicking patterns generated by data processing in multichannel scanners. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of proper likelihood models leads to an increased ability to resolve fiber crossings with smaller inter-fiber angles and to better detect non-dominant fibers. The inclusion of TV regularization dramatically improved the resolution power of both techniques. The above findings were also verified in brain data.},

The distribution of phase shifts is shown to be Gaussian in the limits when the time between pulses is either long or short compared to the time required for a spin to diffuse from one boundary to another. The distribution is assumed to be Gaussian in the intermediate case, and the problem is reduced to the calculation of the mean square phase change due to diffusion. Expressions for spin echo amplitudes are derived for the cases of planar, spherical, and cylindrical boundaries, and forms are derived that are valid when the time of the measurement is very long or very short compared with the time required for diffusion between boundaries.},

abstract = {Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Most of the existing mixture models work with linear data; whereas, real-life applications may involve multivariate data having both circular and linear characteristics. No existing mixture models can accommodate such correlated circular?linear data. In this paper, we consider designing a mixture model for multivariate data having one circular variable. In order to construct a circular?linear joint distribution with proper inclusion of correlation terms, we use the semi-wrapped Gaussian distribution. Further, we construct a mixture model (termed SWGMM) of such joint distributions. This mixture model is capable of approximating the distribution of multi-modal circular?linear data. An unsupervised learning of the mixture parameters is proposed based on expectation maximization method. Clustering is performed using maximum a posteriori criterion. To evaluate the performance of SWGMM, we choose the task of color image segmentation in LCH space. We present comprehensive results and compare SWGMM with existing methods. Our study reveals that the proposed mixture model outperforms the other methods in most cases.},

The fact that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying tissue microstructure provides a unique method of assessing the orientation and integrity of these neural fibres, which may be useful in assessing a number of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous system.},

abstract = {In recent years, diffusion MRI has become an extremely important tool for studying the morphology of living brain tissue, as it provides unique insights into both its macrostructure and microstructure. Recent applications of diffusion MRI aimed to characterize the structural connectome using tractography to infer connectivity between brain regions. In parallel to the development of tractography, additional diffusion MRI based frameworks (CHARMED, AxCaliber, ActiveAx) were developed enabling the extraction of a multitude of micro-structural parameters (axon diameter distribution, mean axonal diameter and axonal density). This unique insight into both tissue microstructure and connectivity has enormous potential value in understanding the structure and organization of the brain as well as providing unique insights to abnormalities that underpin disease states.The CONNECT (Consortium Of Neuroimagers for the Non-invasive Exploration of brain Connectivity and Tracts) project aimed to combine tractography and micro-structural measures of the living human brain in order to obtain a better estimate of the connectome, while also striving to extend validation of these measurements. This paper summarizes the project and describes the perspective of using micro-structural measures to study the connectome. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {At a superficial level, the idea of maximum likelihood must be prehistoric: early hunters and gatherers may not have used the words ``method of maximum likelihood'' to describe their choice of where and how to hunt and gather, but it is hard to believe they would have been surprised if their method had been described in those terms. It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who would rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood, or even mediocre likelihood? And yet the mathematical history of the topic shows this ``simple idea'' is really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of those who explored the topic, not always in ways we would sanction today. In this article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time of Lucien Le Cam's dissertation. In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930 characterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum likelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three proofs discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and his later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's Relation for homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher's work is reviewed, and some lessons drawn.},

To test these models we use a rich dataset acquired in vivo on the corpus callosum of a human brain, and then compare the models via the Bayesian Information Criteria. We test this ranking via bootstrapping on the data sets, and cross-validate across unseen parts of the protocol. We find that models that capture fibre dispersion are preferred.

ITK(4) makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK. ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions; it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional (affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available. Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},

abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) faces the challenging task of bringing multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities together in a common automated preprocessing framework across a large cohort of subjects. The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3. Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

The rotationally invariant nature of particular{\$}\backslash{\$}ndiffusion anisotropy indices (e.g. FA, LI) allows orientation-independent{\$}\backslash{\$}ncomparisons of these parameters between different subjects. Pathophysiological{\$}\backslash{\$}nprocesses (such as cerebral ischemia) that modify the integrity of{\$}\backslash{\$}nthe tissue microstructure result in significant alterations in tissue{\$}\backslash{\$}nanisotropy and make this metric a useful endpoint for characterizing{\$}\backslash{\$}nthe temporal evolution of the disease. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI){\$}\backslash{\$}nstudies of both experimental and human stroke suggest that DTI may{\$}\backslash{\$}nprovide additional information about the evolution of the disease{\$}\backslash{\$}nthat is not available from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) alone.

abstract = {Biophysical models that describe the outcome of white matter diffusion MRI experiments have various degrees of complexity. While the simplest models assume equal-sized and parallel axons, more elaborate ones may include distributions of axon diameters and axonal orientation dispersions. These microstructural features can be inferred from diffusion-weighted signal attenuation curves by solving an inverse problem, validated in several Monte Carlo simulation studies. Model development has been paralleled by microscopy studies of the microstructure of excised and fixed nerves, confirming that axon diameter estimates from diffusion measurements agree with those from microscopy. However, results obtained in vivo are less conclusive. For example, the amount of slowly diffusing water is lower than expected, and the diffusion-encoded signal is apparently insensitive to diffusion time variations, contrary to what may be expected. Recent understandings of the resolution limit in diffusion MRI, the rate of water exchange, and the presence of microscopic axonal undulation and axonal orientation dispersions may, however, explain such apparent contradictions. Knowledge of the effects of biophysical mechanisms on water diffusion in tissue can be used to predict the outcome of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) studies. Alterations of DTI or DKI parameters found in studies of pathologies such as ischemic stroke can thus be compared with those predicted by modelling. Observations in agreement with the predictions strengthen the credibility of biophysical models; those in disagreement could provide clues of how to improve them. DKI is particularly suited for this purpose; it is performed using higher b-values than DTI, and thus carries more information about the tissue microstructure. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current understanding of how various properties of the tissue microstructure and the rate of water exchange between microenvironments are reflected in diffusion MRI measurements. We focus on the use of biophysical models for extracting tissue-specific parameters from data obtained with single PGSE sequences on clinical MRI scanners, but results obtained with animal MRI scanners are also considered. While modelling of white matter is the central theme, experiments on model systems that highlight important aspects of the biophysical models are also reviewed.},

abstract = {The normal distribution is a common model of randomness. Unlike the uniform distribution, it proposes a most probable value which is also the mean, while other values occur with a probability that decreases in a regular way with distance from the mean. This behavior is mathematically very satisfying, and has an easily observed correspondence with many physical processes. One drawback of the normal distribution, however, is that it supplies a positive probability density to every value in the range (−∞, +∞), although the actual probability of an extreme event will be very low. In many cases, it is desired to use the normal distribution to describe the random variation of a quantity that, for physical reasons, must be strictly positive. A mathematically defensible way to preserve the main features of the normal distribution while avoiding extreme values involves the truncated normal distribution, in which the range of definition is made finite at one or both ends of the interval. It is the purpose of this report to describe the truncation process, to consider how certain basic statistical properties of the new distribution can be determined, to show how to efficiently sample the distribution, and how to construct an associated quadrature rule, or even a sparse grid quadrature rule for a problem with multidimensional randomness.},

abstract = {Conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures water diffusion parameters based on the assumption that the spin displacement distribution is a Gaussian function. However, water movement in biological tissue is often non-Gaussian and this non-Gaussian behavior may contain useful information related to tissue structure and pathophysiology. Here we propose an approach to directly measure the non-Gaussian property of water diffusion, characterized by a four-dimensional matrix referred to as the diffusion kurtosis tensor. This approach does not require the complete measurement of the displacement distribution function and, therefore, is more time efficient compared with the q-space imaging technique. A theoretical framework of the DK calculation is established, and experimental results are presented for humans obtained within a clinically feasible time of about 10 min. The resulting kurtosis maps are shown to be robust and reproducible. Directionally-averaged apparent kurtosis coefficients (AKC, a unitless parameter) are 0.74 +/- 0.03, 1.09 +/- 0.01 and 0.84 +/- 0.02 for gray matter, white matter and thalamus, respectively. The three-dimensional kurtosis angular plots show tissue-specific geometry for different brain regions and demonstrate the potential of identifying multiple fiber structures in a single voxel. Diffusion kurtosis imaging is a useful method to study non-Gaussian diffusion behavior and can provide complementary information to that of DTI.},

In the limit of long correlation times it is identical to Torrey's well-known formula for spin echo attenuation due to self-diffusion. The method is used to derive the expression for spin-echo attenuation of diffusion in restricted regions. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Indices of diffusion anisotropy calculated from diffusion coefficients acquired in two or three perpendicular directions are rotationally variant. In living monkey brain, these indices severely underestimate the degree of diffusion anisotropy. New indices calculated from the entire diffusion tensor are rotationally invariant (RI). They show that anisotropy is highly variable in different white matter regions depending on the degree of coherence of fiber tract directions. In structures with a regular, parallel fiber arrangement, water diffusivity in the direction parallel to the fibers (Dparallel approximately 1400-1800 x 10(-6) mm2/s) is almost 10 times higher than the average diffusivity in directions perpendicular to them (D + D)/2 [corrected] approximately 150-300 x 10(-6) mm2/s), and is almost three times higher than previously reported. In structures where the fiber pattern is less coherent (e.g., where fiber bundles merge), diffusion anisotropy is significantly reduced. However, RI anisotropy indices are still susceptible to noise contamination. Monte Carlo simulations show that these indices are statistically biased, particularly those requiring sorting of the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor based on their magnitude. A new intervoxel anisotropy index is proposed that locally averages inner products between diffusion tensors in neighboring voxels. This "lattice" RI index has an acceptably low error variance and is less susceptible to bias than any other RI anisotropy index proposed to date.},

abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts) in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically along each tract for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in the brains of typically developing children and children at risk for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First, fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects. Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare white matter properties of individual patients to standardized Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation, AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical management and decision-making.},

abstract = {Obtaining reliable data and drawing meaningful and robust inferences from diffusion MRI can be challenging and is subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion indices and eventually comparing them between groups of subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors. This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion MRI analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported) into a single article, which should serve as a useful reference for those embarking on new diffusion MRI-based studies, and as a check for those who may already be running studies but may have overlooked some important confounds. While some of these problems are well known to diffusion experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to undertake a clinical study based on diffusion MRI.},

The developments are partly motivated by computational challenges arising in fitting models of increasing heterogeneity to increasingly large datasets. An example context concerns common biological studies using high-throughput technologies gen-erating many, very large datasets and requiring increasingly high-dimensional mixture models with large numbers of mixture components. We outline important strategies and processes for GPU computation in Bayesian simulation and optimization approaches, give examples of the benefits of GPU implementations in terms of processing speed and scale-up in ability to analyze large datasets, and provide a detailed, tutorial-style expo-sition that will benefit readers interested in developing GPU-based approaches in other statistical models. Novel, GPU-oriented approaches to modifying existing algorithms software design can lead to vast speed-up and, critically, enable statistical analyses that presently will not be performed due to compute time limitations in traditional computa-tional environments. Supplemental materials are provided with all source code, example data, and details that will enable readers to implement and explore the GPU approach in this mixture modeling context.},

abstract = {The Fisher-matrix formalism is used routinely in the literature on gravitational-wave detection to characterize the parameter-estimation performance of gravitational-wave measurements, given parametrized models of the waveforms, and assuming detector noise of known colored Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, the Fisher matrix can be a poor predictor of the amount of information obtained from typical observations, especially for waveforms with several parameters and relatively low expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or for waveforms depending weakly on one or more parameters, when their priors are not taken into proper consideration. In this paper I discuss these pitfalls; show how they occur, even for relatively strong signals, with a commonly used template family for binary-inspiral waveforms; and describe practical recipes to recognize them and cope with them. Specifically, I answer the following questions: (i) What is the significance of (quasi-)singular Fisher matrices, and how must we deal with them? (ii) When is it necessary to take into account prior probability distributions for the source parameters? (iii) When is the signal-to-noise ratio high enough to believe the Fisher-matrix result? In addition, I provide general expressions for the higher-order, beyond--Fisher-matrix terms in the 1/SNR expansions for the expected parameter accuracies.},

The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward effi- ciency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form.

abstract = {Purpose: Linear least squares estimators are widely used in diffusion MRI for the estimation of diffusion parameters. Although adding proper weights is necessary to increase the precision of these linear estimators, there is no consensus on how to practically define them. In this study, the impact of the commonly used weighting strategies on the accuracy and precision of linear diffusion parameter estimators is evaluated and compared with the nonlinear least squares estimation approach. Methods: Simulation and real data experiments were done to study the performance of the weighted linear least squares estimators with weights defined by (a) the squares of the respective noisy diffusion-weighted signals; and (b) the squares of the predicted signals, which are reconstructed from a previous estimate of the diffusion model parameters. Results: The negative effect of weighting strategy (a) on the accuracy of the estimator was surprisingly high. Multi-step weighting strategies yield better performance and, in some cases, even outperformed the nonlinear least squares estimator. Conclusion: If proper weighting strategies are applied, the weighted linear least squares approach shows high performance characteristics in terms of accuracy/precision and may even be preferred over nonlinear estimation methods. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a clinically feasible extension of diffusion tensor imaging that probes restricted water diffusion in biological tissues using magnetic resonance imaging. Here we provide a physically meaningful interpretation of DKI metrics in white matter regions consisting of more or less parallel aligned fiber bundles by modeling the tissue as two non-exchanging compartments, the intra-axonal space and extra-axonal space. For the b-values typically used in DKI, the diffusion in each compartment is assumed to be anisotropic Gaussian and characterized by a diffusion tensor. The principal parameters of interest for the model include the intra- and extra-axonal diffusion tensors, the axonal water fraction and the tortuosity of the extra-axonal space. A key feature is that these can be determined directly from the diffusion metrics conventionally obtained with DKI. For three healthy young adults, the model parameters are estimated from the DKI metrics and shown to be consistent with literature values. In addition, as a partial validation of this DKI-based approach, we demonstrate good agreement between the DKI-derived axonal water fraction and the slow diffusion water fraction obtained from standard biexponential fitting to high b-value diffusion data. Combining the proposed WM model with DKI provides a convenient method for the clinical assessment of white matter in health and disease and could potentially provide important information on neurodegenerative disorders. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was rapidly implemented by major MRI scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, DTI was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, DTI is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved DW-MRI methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of DTI, we review the physics of DW-MRI, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of 'Do's and Don'ts' which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Timmers2015,
abstract = {White matter abnormalities have been observed in patients with classic galactosemia, an inborn error of galactose metabolism. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected in the past were generally qualitative in nature. Our objective was to investigate white matter microstructure pathology and examine correlations with outcome and behaviour in this disease, by using multi-shell diffusion weighted imaging. In addition to standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) was used to estimate density and orientation dispersion of neurites in a group of eight patients (aged 16-21 years) and eight healthy controls (aged 15-20 years). Extensive white matter abnormalities were found: neurite density index (NDI) was lower in the patient group in bilateral anterior areas, and orientation dispersion index (ODI) was increased mainly in the left hemisphere. These specific regional profiles are in agreement with the cognitive profile observed in galactosemia, showing higher order cognitive impairments, and language and motor impairments, respectively. Less favourable white matter properties correlated positively with age and age at onset of diet, and negatively with behavioural outcome (e.g. visual working memory). To conclude, this study provides evidence of white matter pathology regarding density and dispersion of neurites in these patients. The results are discussed in light of suggested pathophysiological mechanisms.},

@article{Benitez2014,
abstract = {Post-mortem and imaging studies have observed that white matter (WM) degenerates in a pattern inverse to myelin development, suggesting preferential regional vulnerabilities influencing cognitive decline in AD. This study applied novel WM tract integrity (WMTI) metrics derived from diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) to examine WM tissue properties in AD within this framework. Using data from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 12), AD (n = 14), and normal control (NC; n = 15) subjects, mixed models revealed interaction effects: specific WMTI metrics of axonal density and myelin integrity (i.e. axonal water fraction, radial extra-axonal diffusivity) in late-myelinating tracts (i.e. superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) changed in the course of disease, but were stable in the initial stages for early-myelinating tracts (i.e. posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncles). WMTI metrics in late-myelinating tracts correlated with semantic verbal fluency, a cognitive function known to decline in AD. These findings corroborate the preferential vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts, and illustrate an application of WMTI metrics to characterizing the regional course of WM changes in AD. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

@article{DeSantis2014a,
abstract = {Fundamental to increasing our understanding of the role of white matter microstructure in normal/abnormal function in the living human is the development of MR-based metrics that provide increased specificity to distinct attributes of the white matter (e.g., local fibre architecture, axon morphology, and myelin content). In recent years, different approaches have been developed to enhance this specificity, and the Tractometry framework was introduced to combine the resulting multi-parametric data for a comprehensive assessment of white matter properties. The present work exploits that framework to characterise the statistical properties, specifically the variance and covariance, of these advanced microstructural indices across the major white matter pathways, with the aim of giving clear indications on the preferred metric(s) given the specific research question.A cohort of healthy subjects was scanned with a protocol that combined multi-component relaxometry with conventional and advanced diffusion MRI acquisitions to build the first comprehensive MRI atlas of white matter microstructure. The mean and standard deviation of the different metrics were analysed in order to understand how they vary across different brain regions/individuals and the correlation between them. Characterising the fibre architectural complexity (in terms of number of fibre populations in a voxel) provides clear insights into correlation/lack of correlation between the different metrics and explains why DT-MRI is a good model for white matter only some of the time. The study also identifies the metrics that account for the largest inter-subject variability and reports the minimal sample size required to detect differences in means, showing that, on the other hand, conventional DT-MRI indices might still be the safest choice in many contexts. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},
